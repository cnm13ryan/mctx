## ClassDef SeqHalvingTest
**SeqHalvingTest**: The function of SeqHalvingTest is to test the sequence halving mechanism by verifying that the number of considered visits matches expected results under various scenarios.

attributes: The attributes of this Class.
· No explicit class-level or instance-level attributes are defined in the provided code snippet. The tests rely on local variables within each method.

Code Description: The description of this Class.
SeqHalvingTest is a subclass of absltest.TestCase, designed to test the sequence halving mechanism implemented in the seq_halving module. It includes several test methods that validate the correctness of the get_sequence_of_considered_visits function under different conditions. Each test method sets up specific parameters such as max_num_considered_actions and num_simulations, then compares the actual results returned by the function with expected_results using assertions.

The _check_visits helper method is used across multiple tests to perform these comparisons. It takes three arguments: expected_results (a list of integers representing the expected sequence of considered visits), max_num_considered_actions (the maximum number of actions that can be considered at any point in the sequence halving process), and num_simulations (the total number of simulations to run). The method first checks if the length of expected_results matches num_simulations, then retrieves the actual results from the get_sequence_of_considered_visits function and asserts that they match the expected values.

The test methods cover various scenarios:
- test_considered_min_sims: Tests the case where the number of simulations is exactly equal to max_num_considered_actions * log2(max_num_considered_actions).
- test_considered_extra_sims: Tests the scenario with more simulations than required.
- test_considered_less_sims and test_considered_less_sims2: Test cases with fewer simulations, including a case where num_simulations is less than max_num_considered_actions * log2(max_num_considered_actions).
- test_considered_not_power_of_2: Tests the sequence halving mechanism when max_num_considered_actions is not a power of 2.
- test_considered_action0 and test_considered_action1: Test edge cases where max_num_considered_actions is set to 0 or 1.

Note: Points to note about the use of the code
This class is intended for testing purposes only. It relies on the correct implementation of the get_sequence_of_considered_visits function in the seq_halving module. Developers should ensure that this function behaves as expected before running these tests. The test methods assume specific behavior and results, so any changes to the underlying sequence halving logic may require updates to the expected_results in each test.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
While SeqHalvingTest does not directly return values, it performs assertions that will either pass silently or raise an AssertionError if the actual results do not match the expected results. For example, in test_considered_min_sims, the assertion would pass if the get_sequence_of_considered_visits function returns the following tuple:
(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6)
If the function returns a different sequence, an AssertionError will be raised indicating that the test has failed.
### FunctionDef _check_visits(self, expected_results, max_num_considered_actions, num_simulations)
**_check_visits**: The function of _check_visits is to verify that the sequence of considered visits generated by the Sequential Halving algorithm matches the expected results.

parameters: 
· expected_results: A list or tuple containing the expected visit counts for each simulation.
· max_num_considered_actions: The maximum number of actions to be considered during the simulations, which can be smaller than the total number of actions.
· num_simulations: The total number of simulations to be conducted.

Code Description: The function _check_visits is designed to test the correctness of the sequence generated by the Sequential Halving algorithm. It first asserts that the length of the expected results matches the number of simulations, ensuring that the test setup is consistent with the expected output size. Then, it calls the get_sequence_of_considered_visits function from seq_halving.py, passing in max_num_considered_actions and num_simulations to generate the actual sequence of considered visits. Finally, it compares this generated sequence against the expected results using an assertion to confirm that they are identical.

The function _check_visits is utilized within several test methods in the SeqHalvingTest class located in seq_halving_test.py. These tests cover various scenarios including cases where the number of simulations is exactly equal to, more than, or less than the product of max_num_considered_actions and its logarithm base 2. Additionally, it includes tests for situations where max_num_considered_actions is not a power of two and when it is set to values of 0 and 1.

Note: The function assumes that expected_results, max_num_considered_actions, and num_simulations are correctly provided as per the requirements of the Sequential Halving algorithm. It does not handle cases where these parameters might be invalid or inconsistent with each other.

Output Example: For a call to _check_visits with expected_results = [0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3], max_num_considered_actions = 4, and num_simulations = 8, the function will pass if the sequence generated by get_sequence_of_considered_visits matches the expected results exactly. If there is any discrepancy between the generated sequence and the expected results, an assertion error will be raised indicating a failure in the test.

### FunctionDef test_considered_min_sims(self)
**test_considered_min_sims**: The function of test_considered_min_sims is to verify that the sequence of considered visits generated by the Sequential Halving algorithm matches the expected results when using exactly `num_simulations = max_num_considered_actions * log2(max_num_considered_actions)`.

parameters: This Function does not take any parameters directly as it uses predefined values within its body.
· num_sims: The total number of simulations to be conducted, set to 24 in this test case.
· max_num_considered: The maximum number of actions to be considered during the simulations, set to 8 in this test case.
· expected_results: A list containing the expected visit counts for each simulation.

Code Description: The function test_considered_min_sims is designed to test a specific scenario of the Sequential Halving algorithm where the number of simulations is exactly equal to the product of `max_num_considered_actions` and its logarithm base 2. It initializes `num_sims` to 24 and `max_num_considered` to 8, which corresponds to the formula `num_simulations = max_num_considered_actions * log2(max_num_considered_actions)` for `max_num_considered_actions = 8`. The expected sequence of considered visits is defined in `expected_results`, which includes detailed steps of how actions are considered across different rounds of simulation. This function then calls `_check_visits` with these parameters to verify the correctness of the generated sequence against the expected results.

The function assumes that the Sequential Halving algorithm behaves as expected under the given conditions and that the `get_sequence_of_considered_visits` function correctly generates the sequence based on the provided parameters. It does not handle cases where these assumptions might be violated, such as invalid or inconsistent parameter values.

Note: The function is part of a larger test suite for the Sequential Halving algorithm and is specifically designed to validate the behavior when the number of simulations matches the theoretical maximum derived from the algorithm's properties. Developers should ensure that the parameters used in this test accurately reflect the intended scenario and that the expected results are correctly defined based on the algorithm's logic.

### FunctionDef test_considered_extra_sims(self)
**test_considered_extra_sims**: The function of test_considered_extra_sims is to verify that the Sequential Halving algorithm correctly handles scenarios where the number of simulations exceeds the product of max_num_considered_actions and its logarithm base 2.

parameters: This function does not take any parameters directly. It uses predefined values within the function body.
· num_sims: The total number of simulations set to 47.
· max_num_considered: The maximum number of actions considered during each round, set to 8.
· expected_results: A list containing the expected visit counts for each simulation.

Code Description: The test_considered_extra_sims function is designed to validate the behavior of the Sequential Halving algorithm when more simulations are conducted than what would be typically required based on the formula `max_num_considered_actions * log2(max_num_considered_actions)`. In this specific test, 47 simulations are performed with a maximum of 8 actions considered at each step. The expected results list specifies the sequence of visits that should occur during these simulations according to the Sequential Halving algorithm.

The function initializes the number of simulations (`num_sims`) and the maximum number of considered actions (`max_num_considered`). It then defines an `expected_results` list, which contains the anticipated visit counts for each simulation. This list is structured based on how the Sequential Halving algorithm should distribute its evaluations across different rounds and actions.

The function calls `_check_visits`, a helper method within the same class, to perform the actual validation. The `_check_visits` method takes three arguments: `expected_results`, `max_num_considered`, and `num_sims`. It first checks that the length of `expected_results` matches `num_sims` to ensure consistency in test setup. Then, it retrieves the sequence of considered visits generated by the Sequential Halving algorithm using the `get_sequence_of_considered_visits` function from the `seq_halving.py` module. Finally, it compares this generated sequence against the `expected_results` list to verify correctness.

Note: The function assumes that the `expected_results` list accurately reflects the expected behavior of the Sequential Halving algorithm for the given parameters. It is crucial that this list be correctly defined based on the algorithm's logic and the specific test scenario being evaluated. Additionally, the function relies on the `_check_visits` method to perform the actual validation, ensuring that any discrepancies between the generated sequence and the expected results are caught and reported as assertion errors.

Code Description: The function test_considered_less_sims is designed to test a specific scenario within the Sequential Halving algorithm by using a very small number of simulations. It sets num_sims to 2 and max_num_considered to 8, with expected_results predefined as [0, 0]. These values are then passed to the _check_visits method, which is responsible for verifying that the sequence of considered visits generated by the algorithm matches the expected results.

The function first initializes the number of simulations (num_sims) and the maximum number of actions to be considered during these simulations (max_num_considered). It also sets up the expected_results list, which contains the anticipated visit counts for each simulation. These values are then used as arguments in a call to the _check_visits method.

The _check_visits method is crucial for this test as it performs the actual verification process. It asserts that the length of the expected results matches the number of simulations, ensuring consistency between the test setup and the expected output size. The method then generates the sequence of considered visits by calling get_sequence_of_considered_visits from seq_halving.py with max_num_considered and num_simulations as arguments.

Code Description: The function test_considered_less_sims2 is designed to test a specific scenario within the Sequential Halving algorithm where the total number of simulations (num_sims) is less than the product of max_num_considered and its logarithm base 2. This setup ensures that the algorithm does not consider all possible actions in every simulation, instead halving the number of considered actions as it progresses through the simulations.

The function initializes num_sims to 13 and max_num_considered to 8. It then defines a list called expected_results, which contains the anticipated visit counts for each simulation based on the Sequential Halving algorithm's behavior with these parameters. The expected results are structured such that in the first 8 simulations, all actions are considered (hence 0s), in the next 4 simulations, half of the actions are considered (hence 1s), and in the final simulation, only one action is considered (hence a 2).

The function calls _check_visits, passing in expected_results, max_num_considered, and num_sims. The _check_visits function is responsible for asserting that the length of the expected results matches the number of simulations and then comparing the generated sequence of considered visits against the expected results using an assertion.

Note: This test specifically checks the behavior of the Sequential Halving algorithm when the number of simulations is less than the theoretical maximum required to consider all actions at least once. It ensures that the algorithm correctly reduces the number of considered actions as it progresses through the simulations, adhering to its design principles. The function assumes that the parameters provided are consistent with the requirements of the Sequential Halving algorithm and does not handle invalid or inconsistent parameter values.

It initializes num_sims to 24 and max_num_considered to 7, and defines an expected_results list that outlines the anticipated sequence of visits generated by the Sequential Halving algorithm under these conditions. The function then calls _check_visits, passing in the expected results, max_num_considered, and num_sims as arguments. This call verifies that the actual sequence of considered visits matches the expected results, ensuring the correctness of the algorithm's behavior when max_num_considered is not a power of two.

Note: The function assumes that the _check_visits method correctly implements the logic to compare the expected results with the actual sequence generated by the Sequential Halving algorithm. It also relies on the get_sequence_of_considered_visits function from seq_halving.py to generate the sequence of considered visits based on the provided parameters. This test is part of a larger suite designed to validate different scenarios and edge cases for the Sequential Halving algorithm implementation.

parameters: This function does not take any parameters directly as it sets its own values for the test scenario.
· num_sims: The total number of simulations to be conducted, set to 16 in this test case.
· max_num_considered: The maximum number of actions to be considered during the simulations, set to 0 in this test case.
· expected_results: A list or tuple containing the expected visit counts for each simulation, set to a range from 0 to num_sims - 1.

Code Description: The function test_considered_action0 is designed to test a specific scenario of the Sequential Halving algorithm where no actions are considered during the simulations. It sets the number of simulations (num_sims) to 16 and the maximum number of considered actions (max_num_considered) to 0. The expected results are generated as a range from 0 to num_sims - 1, which represents the sequence of visit counts for each simulation if no actions were considered.

The function then calls _check_visits, passing in the expected results, max_num_considered, and num_sims. The _check_visits function is responsible for verifying that the sequence of considered visits generated by the Sequential Halving algorithm matches the expected results. In this case, since max_num_considered is set to 0, the expected behavior is that no actions are considered, and the visit counts should follow the simple range pattern specified.

Note: This test specifically checks the edge case where the maximum number of considered actions is zero, ensuring that the algorithm correctly handles scenarios with no action consideration. The function assumes that _check_visits will handle any discrepancies between the expected results and the actual sequence generated by the Sequential Halving algorithm, raising an assertion error if they do not match.
***
### FunctionDef test_considered_action1(self)
**test_considered_action1**: The function of test_considered_action1 is to verify that the sequence of considered visits generated by the Sequential Halving algorithm matches the expected results when only one action is considered during each simulation.

parameters: 
· This function does not take any explicit parameters. It uses predefined constants within its scope.

Code Description: The function test_considered_action1 initializes two variables, num_sims and max_num_considered, to 16 and 1 respectively. These represent the total number of simulations and the maximum number of actions considered in each simulation. An expected_results list is created using the range function with num_sims as its argument, which generates a sequence from 0 to 15. This sequence represents the anticipated visit counts for each simulation.

The function then calls _check_visits, passing in expected_results, max_num_considered, and num_sims as arguments. The purpose of this call is to verify that the sequence generated by the Sequential Halving algorithm matches the expected results exactly. The _check_visits function performs several checks: it first asserts that the length of expected_results matches num_sims, ensuring consistency between the test setup and the expected output size. It then generates the actual sequence of considered visits using the get_sequence_of_considered_visits function from seq_halving.py with max_num_considered and num_sims as parameters. Finally, it compares this generated sequence against the expected results to confirm that they are identical.

Note: The function assumes that the predefined constants (num_sims and max_num_considered) and the expected_results list are correctly set up according to the requirements of the Sequential Halving algorithm. It does not handle cases where these parameters might be invalid or inconsistent with each other. This test specifically checks the scenario where only one action is considered in each simulation, which simplifies the verification process by expecting a straightforward sequence of visit counts.
