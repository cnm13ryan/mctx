## ClassDef QtransformsTest
**QtransformsTest**: The function of QtransformsTest is to test the behavior of the _compute_mixed_value() function from the qtransforms module.

attributes: The attributes of this Class.
· No explicit class-level or instance-level attributes are defined in the provided code snippet. The tests utilize local variables within their respective methods.

Code Description: The description of this Class.
QtransformsTest is a subclass of absltest.TestCase, designed to validate the functionality and correctness of the _compute_mixed_value() function from the qtransforms module. This class contains two test methods:

1. **test_mix_value**: This method tests the output of the _compute_mixed_value() function under normal conditions. It sets up a scenario with predefined raw values, prior logits, visit counts, and Q-values. The expected mixed value is calculated based on these inputs using a formula that incorporates the softmax probabilities of the prior logits, the visit counts, and the Q-values. The test asserts that the computed mix_value closely matches the expected_mix_value using np.testing.assert_allclose().

2. **test_mix_value_with_zero_visits**: This method tests the robustness of _compute_mixed_value() when all visit counts are zero. It ensures that the function does not encounter division by zero errors and correctly returns the raw value as the mix value in such cases. The test uses jax.debug_nans() to catch any NaN values resulting from invalid operations, ensuring numerical stability.

Note: Points to note about the use of the code
Developers should ensure that the qtransforms module is properly imported and available in their environment before running these tests. Additionally, familiarity with JAX and NumPy libraries is beneficial for understanding the test setup and assertions. The tests assume specific behaviors and mathematical formulations within _compute_mixed_value(), so any changes to this function may require corresponding updates to the test cases.
### FunctionDef test_mix_value(self)
**test_mix_value**: The function of test_mix_value is to verify the correctness of the _compute_mixed_value() function by comparing its output against an expected value.

parameters: The parameters of this Function.
· No explicit parameters are defined for this function as it operates with predefined values within the test case.

Code Description: The description of this Function.
The function test_mix_value is a unit test designed to validate the functionality of _compute_mixed_value, which calculates an interpolated state value based on raw values, Q-values, visit counts, and prior probabilities. Within the test, specific inputs are defined for each parameter:
- `raw_value` is set to -0.8.
- `prior_logits` is initialized with [-inf, -1.0, 2.0, -inf], which are then transformed into probabilities using softmax, resulting in `probs`.
- `visit_counts` is specified as [0, 4.0, 4.0, 0].
- `qvalues` is defined as [20.0, 3.0, -1.0, 10.0], scaled by a factor of 10.0 / 54.

The function then calls _compute_mixed_value with these inputs to compute the mixed value. The expected mixed value is calculated manually based on the formula:
\[ \text{expected\_mix\_value} = \frac{1}{\text{num\_simulations} + 1} \times (\text{raw\_value} + \text{num\_simulations} \times (\text{probs}[1] \times \text{qvalues}[1] + \text{probs}[2] \times \text{qvalues}[2])) \]
where `num_simulations` is the sum of all visit counts.

The test uses `np.testing.assert_allclose` to compare the computed mixed value from _compute_mixed_value with the expected mixed value, ensuring that they are approximately equal within a tolerance level. This comparison confirms the accuracy and reliability of the _compute_mixed_value function under the specified conditions.

Note: Points to note about the use of the code
This test is part of the testing suite for the mctx library, specifically targeting the functionality of the _compute_mixed_value method. It ensures that the method behaves as expected when provided with a set of predefined inputs. Developers should ensure that similar tests are conducted for different scenarios and edge cases to maintain robustness in the implementation. The use of `np.testing.assert_allclose` allows for a flexible comparison, accommodating minor numerical differences that may arise from floating-point arithmetic operations.

### FunctionDef test_mix_value_with_zero_visits(self)
**test_mix_value_with_zero_visits**: The function of test_mix_value_with_zero_visits is to verify that the _compute_mixed_value function handles cases where all visit counts are zero without causing division by zero errors.

parameters: This function does not take any parameters as it is a unit test method designed to run with predefined values within its scope.

Code Description: The description of this Function.
The function test_mix_value_with_zero_visits is a unit test specifically crafted to ensure the robustness and correctness of the _compute_mixed_value function under conditions where no actions have been visited, i.e., all visit counts are zero. This scenario poses a potential risk for division by zero errors within the _compute_mixed_value function due to the presence of operations that depend on the sum of visit counts.

To simulate this condition, the test initializes several variables:
- `raw_value` is set to -0.8, representing an approximate value of the state.
- `prior_logits` are initialized with values [-inf, -1.0, 2.0, -inf], which are then transformed into probabilities using the softmax function, resulting in `probs`.
- `visit_counts` is explicitly set to [0, 0, 0, 0] to represent that no actions have been visited.
- `qvalues` is initialized as an array of zeros with the same shape as `probs`, indicating undefined Q-values for all actions.

The test then proceeds to call the _compute_mixed_value function within a context manager `jax.debug_nans()` which helps in catching any NaN values that might arise from invalid operations such as division by zero. The purpose here is to ensure that even when all visit counts are zero, the function does not produce undefined results.

Finally, the test uses `np.testing.assert_allclose` to assert that the computed mixed value (`mix_value`) is equal to the raw value (-0.8). This assertion confirms that in scenarios with no visits, the _compute_mixed_value function correctly returns the raw value without attempting any division by zero operations.

In the context of the project, this test serves as a critical safeguard against potential runtime errors and ensures that the _compute_mixed_value function behaves predictably under edge cases. It is part of a suite of tests designed to validate the functionality and reliability of the Q-value transformation logic implemented in the mctx library.

Note: Points to note about the use of the code
This test should be run as part of the project's testing suite to ensure that the _compute_mixed_value function remains robust against scenarios with zero visit counts. Developers are encouraged to maintain this test and add similar tests for other edge cases to further enhance the reliability of the Q-value transformation logic. The use of `jax.debug_nans()` is crucial in catching any unexpected NaN values, which could indicate a division by zero or other invalid operations within the function.
