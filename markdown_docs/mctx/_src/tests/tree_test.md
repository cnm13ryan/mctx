## FunctionDef _prepare_root(batch_size, num_actions)
**_prepare_root**: The function of _prepare_root is to initialize the root node's state by generating consistent outputs based on stored expected trees.

parameters:
· batch_size: An integer representing the number of batch elements.
· num_actions: An integer representing the number of possible actions.

Code Description: The function starts by creating a JAX PRNGKey with a seed value of 0. It then generates a list of rng_keys, each modified for different batch elements using jax.random.fold_in. These keys are used to create embeddings by stacking them into a single array. The function utilizes jax.vmap to apply _produce_prediction_output across the batch elements, generating outputs that include policy logits, value, and embedding. The results are then returned as an instance of mctx.RootFnOutput, which encapsulates these components.

In the context of the project, _prepare_root is utilized in TreeTest within the run_policy method. Here, it initializes the root node's state by calling _produce_prediction_output for each batch element, ensuring that the simulation starts with a consistent and well-defined initial state. This function plays a crucial role in setting up the environment for Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithms.

Note: The batch_size parameter should be a positive integer indicating the number of parallel simulations or batch elements to process. Similarly, num_actions must be a positive integer corresponding to the number of possible actions in the environment. Incorrect values may lead to errors or unexpected behavior.

Output Example: A possible return value from _prepare_root could look like this:
{
    'prior_logits': array([[-0.2345, 1.6789, -0.9876], [0.1234, -0.5678, 0.9876]], dtype=float32),
    'value': array([0.4567, -0.1234], dtype=float32),
    'embedding': DeviceArray([[0.1234, 0.5678], [0.9876, -0.1234]], dtype=float32)
}
## FunctionDef _produce_prediction_output(rng_key, num_actions)
_produce_prediction_output: The function of _produce_prediction_output is to generate model outputs including policy logits, value, and reward based on a given random number generator key and the number of actions.

parameters:
· rng_key: A JAX PRNGKey used for generating random numbers.
· num_actions: An integer representing the number of possible actions.

Code Description: The function starts by splitting the provided rng_key into three separate keys using jax.random.split. These keys are then used to generate different types of outputs independently. First, it generates a value and reward from uniform distributions ranging from -1 to 1. Then, it produces policy logits for each action using a normal distribution. The function returns these values in a dictionary format.

In the context of the project, _produce_prediction_output is utilized by two other functions: _prepare_root and recurrent_fn. In _prepare_root, this function is called within a vmap to generate outputs for multiple batch elements, contributing to the initialization of the root node's state. Similarly, in recurrent_fn, it is used to update the state based on actions taken during the simulation, generating new rewards, discounts, prior logits, and values.

Note: The rng_key parameter should be a valid JAX PRNGKey object. Incorrect or improperly generated keys may lead to unpredictable results. Additionally, num_actions must be a positive integer corresponding to the number of possible actions in the environment.

Output Example: A possible return value from _produce_prediction_output could look like this:
{
    'policy_logits': array([-0.2345, 1.6789, -0.9876], dtype=float32),
    'value': 0.4567,
    'reward': -0.1234
}
## FunctionDef _prepare_recurrent_fn(num_actions)
**_prepare_recurrent_fn**: The function of _prepare_recurrent_fn is to return a dynamics function that is consistent with the expected trees.

parameters: 
· num_actions: An integer representing the number of possible actions.
· discount: A float value used as the discount factor in the recurrent function output.
· zero_reward: A boolean flag indicating whether the reward should be set to zero.

Code Description: The _prepare_recurrent_fn function constructs and returns a recurrent function tailored for use with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithms. This returned function, named recurrent_fn, takes four parameters: params, rng_key, action, and embedding. Inside recurrent_fn, the params and rng_key arguments are ignored. The function processes the embeddings by folding in the actions using the _fold_action_in helper function, which is applied to each element of the embedding array via jax.vmap. Following this, another vmap operation applies the _produce_prediction_output function to generate predictions from the modified embeddings. These predictions include rewards, policy logits, and values.

The reward component of the output is then adjusted based on the zero_reward flag; if set to True, the reward is reset to an array of zeros with the same shape as the original reward. The recurrent_fn returns a RecurrentFnOutput object containing the (possibly modified) reward, a discount factor filled to match the reward's shape, the policy logits from the predictions, and the value estimates. Additionally, it returns the updated embeddings.

The returned recurrent_fn is utilized in the run_policy method of the TreeTest class within the mctx/_src/tests/tree_test.py file. Specifically, it is passed as an argument to the policy_fn function call, which also includes other parameters such as params, rng_key, root, num_simulations, qtransform, and invalid_actions.

Note: The recurrent_fn ignores the params and rng_key arguments, focusing solely on processing embeddings and actions. Ensure that the num_actions parameter matches the number of possible actions in your environment to avoid errors during execution.

Output Example: A possible return value from the recurrent_fn could be:
RecurrentFnOutput(
    reward=jnp.array([0., 0.]),
    discount=jnp.array([0.9, 0.9]),
    prior_logits=jnp.array([[0.1, 0.2], [0.3, 0.4]]),
    value=jnp.array([0.5, 0.6])
), embedding=jnp.array([[0.7, 0.8], [0.9, 1.0]])
### FunctionDef recurrent_fn(params, rng_key, action, embedding)
**recurrent_fn**: The function of recurrent_fn is to process embeddings based on actions taken, generate predictions, and return structured output encapsulated in RecurrentFnOutput.

parameters:
· params: Parameters required by the function (currently unused).
· rng_key: A JAX PRNGKey used for generating random numbers (currently unused).
· action: An integer representing the action taken.
· embedding: The current state embeddings to be processed.

Code Description: The recurrent_fn function processes the provided embeddings based on the actions taken. It first discards the params and rng_key parameters as they are not utilized within the function. Then, it updates the embeddings by folding in the action using the _fold_action_in function. This involves splitting the embedding into sub-keys based on the number of possible actions and selecting the sub-key corresponding to the provided action index. After updating the embeddings, the function generates predictions such as reward, policy logits, and value using the _produce_prediction_output function. If a flag zero_reward is set to True, it overrides the generated rewards with zeros. Finally, the function returns an instance of RecurrentFnOutput containing the computed reward, discount, prior logits, and value, along with the updated embedding.

In the context of the project, recurrent_fn is utilized in test cases within mctx/_src/tests/tree_test.py to simulate state transitions and generate outputs for evaluation purposes. It relies on _fold_action_in to update embeddings based on actions and _produce_prediction_output to generate predictions from these updated embeddings.

Note: The params and rng_key parameters are currently unused in the function implementation. Developers should ensure that the action parameter is a valid integer within the range of possible actions, and the embedding parameter is appropriately shaped for processing. Additionally, the zero_reward flag must be correctly set based on whether rewards should be overridden with zeros.

Output Example: A possible return value from recurrent_fn could look like this:
```
(
    RecurrentFnOutput(
        reward=array([0.], dtype=float32),
        discount=array([0.95], dtype=float32),
        prior_logits=array([[0.1, -0.2, 0.3]], dtype=float32),
        value=array([0.4567], dtype=float32)
    ),
    array([[0.123, 0.456, 0.789]])
)
```
***
## FunctionDef _fold_action_in(rng_key, action, num_actions)
**_fold_action_in**: The function of _fold_action_in is to return a new rng key selected by the given action.

parameters: 
· rng_key: A random number generator (rng) key used for generating random numbers.
· action: An integer representing the action taken, which must be a scalar value.
· num_actions: An integer indicating the total number of possible actions.

Code Description: The function _fold_action_in takes an rng_key, an action, and the total number of possible actions as input. It first asserts that the shape of the action is a scalar and its type is jnp.int32 using chex.assert_shape and chex.assert_type respectively. Then, it splits the rng_key into multiple sub-keys based on the num_actions parameter using jax.random.split. Finally, it returns the sub-key corresponding to the provided action index.

In the context of the project, _fold_action_in is called within the recurrent_fn function in mctx/_src/tests/tree_test.py. Specifically, it is used to update embeddings by selecting a sub-rng key for each embedding based on the action taken. This updated embedding is then passed through another vmap operation with _produce_prediction_output to generate predictions such as reward, policy logits, and value.

Note: The function assumes that the action provided is within the valid range of 0 to num_actions - 1. Providing an out-of-range action will result in an index error when accessing sub_rngs[action].

Output Example: If rng_key is a JAX random key, action is 2, and num_actions is 5, _fold_action_in will return the third sub-key (index 2) from the five generated sub-keys.

## FunctionDef _create_pynode(tree, batch_i, node_i, prior, action, reward)
**_create_pynode**: The function of _create_pynode is to construct and return a dictionary containing search statistics extracted from an MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search) tree node.

parameters: 
· tree: An instance of mctx.Tree representing the Monte Carlo Tree Search tree.
· batch_i: An integer index specifying which batch in the tree to access.
· node_i: An integer index specifying which node within the batch to access.
· prior: A floating-point number representing the prior probability of selecting this node.
· action: An optional parameter that, if provided, represents the action taken at this node.
· reward: An optional parameter that, if provided, represents the reward received from taking an action at this node.

Code Description: The _create_pynode function is designed to extract and format specific statistics from a node in an MCTS tree. It constructs a dictionary containing several key pieces of information about the node, including its prior probability (rounded), visit count, value view (rounded), raw value view (rounded), and child statistics. If action and reward parameters are provided, they are also included in the dictionary. The function uses the _round_float helper function to ensure that floating-point numbers are rounded to a consistent number of decimal places for precision and readability.

The function is primarily used within the tree_to_pytree function, which converts an entire MCTS tree into a nested dictionary format. In this context, _create_pynode is called to generate dictionaries representing individual nodes in the tree, including their children if they exist. This allows for a structured representation of the search process and results.

Note: The 'ndigits' parameter in the _round_float function can be adjusted based on the required precision of the output. However, setting an excessively high number of decimal places might not always be necessary depending on the context and could lead to unnecessary computational overhead or misleadingly precise results.

Output Example: A possible return value from _create_pynode might look like this:
{
    'prior': 0.25,
    'visit': 10,
    'value_view': 0.875,
    'raw_value_view': 0.9,
    'child_stats': [],
    'evaluation_index': 3,
    'action': 4,
    'reward': 0.5
}
## FunctionDef _create_bare_pynode(prior, action)
**_create_bare_pynode**: The function of _create_bare_pynode is to create a dictionary representing a basic node structure used in Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) without child nodes or rewards.

parameters: 
· prior: A floating-point number that represents the prior probability of taking an action from this node. This value will be rounded using the _round_float function.
· action: An identifier for the action taken to reach this node from its parent node.

Code Description: The _create_bare_pynode function constructs a dictionary with three key-value pairs:
- 'prior': The prior probability of taking an action, which is rounded to ensure consistent precision using the _round_float function.
- 'child_stats': An empty list that will later hold statistics about child nodes. This node is considered "bare" because it does not have any children yet.
- 'action': The identifier for the action taken to reach this node from its parent.

This function is utilized within the tree_to_pytree function, which converts an MCTS tree into a nested dictionary structure. In the context of tree_to_pytree, _create_bare_pynode is called when a child node has not been expanded (i.e., it does not have any children yet). The returned dictionary represents this unexpanded child node and is appended to the 'child_stats' list of its parent node.

Note: The use of _round_float ensures that the prior probabilities are rounded, which can be important for maintaining consistency in numerical computations and outputs. However, the precision level (ndigits) used by _round_float should be chosen carefully based on the specific requirements of the application to avoid unnecessary computational overhead or misleadingly precise results.

Output Example: If _create_bare_pynode(prior=0.3141592653589793, action=2) is called, the function will return {'prior': 0.3141592653589793, 'child_stats': [], 'action': 2}. Assuming a default rounding precision of 10 decimal places, the prior value remains unchanged in this example.
## FunctionDef _round_float(value, ndigits)
**_round_float**: The function of _round_float is to round a given floating-point number to a specified number of decimal places.
parameters: 
· value: The floating-point number or a number that can be converted to a float, which needs to be rounded.
· ndigits: An integer specifying the number of decimal places to round the number to. The default value is 10.

Code Description: The _round_float function takes two parameters: 'value' and 'ndigits'. It converts the 'value' to a float (if it isn't already) and rounds it to 'ndigits' decimal places using Python's built-in round() function. This function is used in the project within other functions such as '_create_pynode' and '_create_bare_pynode', where it ensures that floating-point numbers representing probabilities, values, rewards, etc., are rounded for consistent and precise output formatting.

Note: The 'ndigits' parameter can be adjusted based on the required precision of the output. However, setting a very high number of decimal places (like the default 10) might not always be necessary depending on the context and could lead to unnecessary computational overhead or misleadingly precise results.

Output Example: If _round_float(3.141592653589793, 2) is called, the function will return 3.14.
## ClassDef TreeTest
**TreeTest**: The function of TreeTest is to verify the correctness of tree structures generated by different algorithms using parameterized test cases.

attributes: The attributes of this Class.
· None: This class does not explicitly define any instance or class attributes. It relies on parameters passed through its methods.

Code Description: The description of this Class.
TreeTest inherits from `parameterized.TestCase`, which allows it to run tests with different configurations using the `@parameterized.named_parameters` decorator. The primary method, `test_tree`, is designed to load a JSON file containing tree data and compare it against a reproduced version generated by running a search algorithm.

The `test_tree` method takes one parameter: `tree_data_path`, which specifies the path to the JSON file containing the tree data. Inside this method, the JSON file is loaded into a Python dictionary named `tree`. The `_reproduce_tree` private method is then called with this dictionary as an argument to generate a reproduced version of the tree.

The `_reproduce_tree` method performs several steps:
1. It selects the appropriate policy function based on the algorithm specified in the tree data.
2. It extracts environment configuration and root node information from the tree data.
3. It sets up the number of actions, simulations, and Q-transform function according to the tree data.
4. It prepares a batch of invalid actions for testing purposes.
5. It defines a `run_policy` function that executes the policy with the specified parameters.
6. It runs the `run_policy` function using JAX's JIT compilation for performance optimization.
7. Finally, it converts the search tree from the policy output into a PyTree format and returns it.

The reproduced tree is then compared to the original tree data using `chex.assert_trees_all_close`, which checks that all corresponding elements in the two trees are close within an absolute tolerance of 1e-3.

Note: Points to note about the use of the code
Ensure that the `shard_count` parameter in the build file matches the number of parameter configurations passed to `test_tree`. This is crucial for proper test execution and result interpretation. The JSON files referenced in the `@parameterized.named_parameters` decorator must be correctly formatted and located at the specified paths.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
The output of this class is not explicitly returned but rather verified through assertions within the tests. However, if we were to describe the expected internal state after running `test_tree`, it would involve:
- A JSON tree structure loaded from a file.
- A reproduced tree generated by executing a search algorithm with specific parameters.
- An assertion that checks the similarity between the original and reproduced trees within an absolute tolerance of 1e-3. If the assertion passes, the test is considered successful; otherwise, it fails.
### FunctionDef test_tree(self, tree_data_path)
**test_tree**: The function of test_tree is to verify that a tree structure can be accurately reproduced from JSON data using a specified policy.

parameters:
· tree_data_path: A string representing the file path to the JSON file containing the tree data.

Code Description: 
The `test_tree` function begins by opening and reading the JSON file located at `tree_data_path`. It then loads the JSON content into a Python dictionary named `tree`. The function proceeds to call `_reproduce_tree`, passing in the `tree` dictionary. This method is responsible for regenerating the tree structure based on the provided data using a specified policy algorithm. After reproducing the tree, the function uses `chex.assert_trees_all_close` to compare the original tree from the JSON data (`tree["tree"]`) with the reproduced tree. The comparison allows for an absolute tolerance of 1e-3 to account for minor numerical differences.

The `_reproduce_tree` method is a critical component of this process, as it handles the logic for reproducing the tree structure using the specified policy algorithm (either 'gumbel_muzero' or 'muzero'). It sets up the necessary configuration parameters such as `env_config`, `num_actions`, and `num_simulations`. The method also defines a transformation function (`qtransform`) based on the configuration provided in the JSON data. A batch of invalid actions is created to ensure that different elements of the batch have varying search tree depths, which helps test the independence of batch computation.

The policy function (`policy_fn`) is selected based on the algorithm specified in the JSON data and executed within a JIT-compiled context using JAX's `jax.jit`. The output from this execution includes a search tree, which is then converted to a PyTree format using the `tree_to_pytree` function. This reproduced tree is returned by `_reproduce_tree` and subsequently compared with the original tree structure.

Note: 
Ensure that the JSON file at `tree_data_path` contains valid tree data structured as expected by the function. The file should include keys such as "algorithm", "env_config", "tree", and "algorithm_config" to facilitate proper reproduction of the tree structure. Additionally, the specified policy algorithms ('gumbel_muzero' or 'muzero') must be correctly implemented and available in the `mctx` module for this function to operate successfully.

#### FunctionDef run_policy
**run_policy**: The function of run_policy is to execute a policy by simulating a tree search using specified parameters and functions.

parameters:
· params: An empty tuple representing additional parameters that might be used by the policy function, though it is currently not utilized.
· rng_key: A JAX PRNGKey object initialized with a seed value of 1, used for generating random numbers during the simulation.
· root: The initial state of the tree's root node, prepared using the _prepare_root function with batch_size and num_actions as arguments.
· recurrent_fn: A dynamics function returned by the _prepare_recurrent_fn function, which processes embeddings and actions to generate predictions for rewards, policy logits, values, and updated embeddings.
· num_simulations: An integer specifying the number of simulations to run from the root node.
· qtransform: A transformation applied to the Q-values during the simulation process.
· invalid_actions: A mask indicating which actions are invalid in the current state.

Code Description: The run_policy function orchestrates a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm by invoking the policy_fn with several key arguments. It initializes the root node's state using the _prepare_root function, which generates consistent outputs based on batch size and number of actions. The recurrent dynamics function is prepared using the _prepare_recurrent_fn function, tailored to handle the environment's specific characteristics such as the number of possible actions and discount factors.

The policy_fn function is then called with these parameters: an empty tuple for additional parameters (params), a PRNGKey for randomness (rng_key), the initialized root node state (root), the recurrent dynamics function (recurrent_fn), the number of simulations to perform (num_simulations), the Q-value transformation (qtransform), and a mask for invalid actions (invalid_actions). The policy_fn leverages these inputs to simulate multiple trajectories from the root, updating the tree based on predictions generated by the recurrent function.

The function returns the result of the policy_fn call, which typically includes information about the selected action, estimated values, and other relevant statistics derived from the simulations.

Note: Ensure that the batch_size, num_actions, and num_simulations parameters are set appropriately to match the environment's requirements. Incorrect values may lead to errors or suboptimal performance during the simulation process.

Output Example: A possible return value from run_policy could be:
{
    'action': 2,
    'value': 0.789,
    'policy_logits': array([-1.234, 0.567, 2.345], dtype=float32),
    'search_stats': {
        'num_visits': array([10, 5, 15], dtype=int32)
    }
}
