## ClassDef MctxTest
**MctxTest**: The function of MctxTest is to verify that the mctx module can be imported correctly and contains specific expected attributes.

attributes: The attributes of this Class.
Â· No explicit attributes are defined within the class definition provided. It inherits from absltest.TestCase, which provides its own set of attributes and methods for testing purposes.

Code Description: The description of this Class.
MctxTest is a subclass of absltest.TestCase, designed specifically to test the import functionality and attribute presence of the mctx module. The class contains one method, `test_import`, which asserts that several specific attributes are present in the mctx module. These attributes include functions such as `gumbel_muzero_policy`, `muzero_policy`, `qtransform_by_min_max`, `qtransform_by_parent_and_siblings`, and `qtransform_completed_by_mix_value`. Additionally, it checks for the presence of classes or data structures named `PolicyOutput`, `RootFnOutput`, and `RecurrentFnOutput` within the mctx module. The use of `self.assertTrue(hasattr(mctx, "attribute_name"))` ensures that each specified attribute is indeed part of the mctx module, thereby confirming the correct importation and integrity of the module.

Note: Points to note about the use of the code
This test class should be run in an environment where the absltest framework is available and the mctx module has been properly installed. The test will pass only if all specified attributes are found within the mctx module, indicating that the module is correctly set up and includes all necessary components for its intended functionality. Developers should ensure that any changes to the mctx module do not inadvertently remove or rename these critical attributes, as this would cause this test to fail.
### FunctionDef test_import(self)
**test_import**: The function of test_import is to verify that specific attributes are correctly imported from the mctx module.

parameters: This Function does not take any parameters.
Code Description: The test_import function is designed to ensure that several expected attributes and classes are available within the mctx module. It uses the assertTrue method from a testing framework (likely unittest or pytest) to check for the presence of these attributes:
- gumbel_muzero_policy
- muzero_policy
- qtransform_by_min_max
- qtransform_by_parent_and_siblings
- qtransform_completed_by_mix_value
- PolicyOutput
- RootFnOutput
- RecurrentFnOutput

Each call to assertTrue checks if the specified attribute exists in the mctx module using the hasattr function. If any of these attributes are missing, the test will fail, indicating an issue with the import or the availability of the expected functionality within the mctx module.

Note: This function is part of a testing suite and should be run as part of the project's automated tests to confirm that the mctx module is correctly set up and all necessary components are accessible. Developers should ensure that any changes to the mctx module do not inadvertently remove or rename these attributes, which would cause this test to fail.
