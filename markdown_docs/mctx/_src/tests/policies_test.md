## FunctionDef _make_bandit_recurrent_fn(rewards, dummy_embedding)
**_make_bandit_recurrent_fn**: The function of _make_bandit_recurrent_fn is to create a recurrent function with a discount factor set to zero.

parameters: 
· rewards: A JAX array containing reward values for each action.
· dummy_embedding: An optional parameter representing a placeholder embedding, defaulting to an empty tuple.

Code Description:
The _make_bandit_recurrent_fn function generates and returns a recurrent function named recurrent_fn. This recurrent function is designed to operate within the context of bandit problems where the discount factor is set to zero, indicating no future rewards are considered in the current decision-making process. The recurrent_fn takes four parameters: params (which is not used), rng_key (a random number generator key, also unused), action (the selected actions for each state), and embedding (an embedding vector that is ignored). Inside the function, it calculates the reward for each action from the rewards array using the indices provided by the action array. It then returns an mctx.RecurrentFnOutput object containing the calculated rewards, a zeroed discount factor, zeroed prior logits initialized to match the shape of the rewards array, and zeroed values corresponding to the rewards. Additionally, it returns the dummy_embedding parameter as is.

The recurrent_fn generated by _make_bandit_recurrent_fn is utilized in several test functions within the project to simulate bandit scenarios where future rewards are disregarded. Specifically, it is used in the test_muzero_policy, test_gumbel_muzero_policy, test_gumbel_muzero_policy_without_invalid_actions, and test_stochastic_muzero_policy methods of the PoliciesTest class. In these tests, the recurrent_fn serves as a component of the policy functions (muzero_policy, gumbel_muzero_policy, stochastic_muzero_policy) to evaluate decision-making processes under conditions where only immediate rewards are considered.

Note: The params and rng_key parameters in the recurrent_fn are not utilized within the function body. This suggests that while these parameters are part of the function signature, they do not influence the computation performed by the function.

Output Example:
The output of _make_bandit_recurrent_fn is a recurrent_fn which, when called with appropriate arguments (params, rng_key, action, embedding), returns an mctx.RecurrentFnOutput object. For example, if rewards = jnp.array([[10.0, 20.0], [30.0, 40.0]]) and action = jnp.array([1, 0]), the recurrent_fn would return:
(mctx.RecurrentFnOutput(reward=jnp.array([20.0, 30.0]), discount=jnp.array([0.0, 0.0]), prior_logits=jnp.array([[0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0]]), value=jnp.array([0.0, 0.0])), ())
### FunctionDef recurrent_fn(params, rng_key, action, embedding)
**recurrent_fn**: The function of recurrent_fn is to compute and return structured output data encapsulated in RecurrentFnOutput based on given action and embedding inputs.

parameters: 
· params: This parameter is present in the function signature but is not used within the function body.
· rng_key: This parameter is also present in the function signature but is not utilized within the function body.
· action: An array representing actions taken by an agent, which is used to index into the rewards matrix to compute the reward for each action.
· embedding: This parameter is included in the function signature but is not used within the function body.

Code Description: The recurrent_fn function computes a reward based on the provided action and a predefined rewards matrix. It then constructs and returns an instance of RecurrentFnOutput, setting the computed reward as the reward attribute. The discount, prior_logits, and value attributes are all set to zero arrays with shapes corresponding to the batch size of the actions. Additionally, the function returns a dummy_embedding, which is not defined within the provided code snippet and should be defined elsewhere in the project.

The relationship with its callees in the project from a functional perspective involves using RecurrentFnOutput to standardize the output format required by other parts of the system, such as algorithms that rely on structured data for decision-making processes. The function is likely used in test cases or demonstration scripts where specific reward structures are needed to simulate different scenarios.

Note: Points to note about the use of the code
It is important to ensure that the rewards matrix and dummy_embedding are properly defined and accessible within the scope where recurrent_fn is called. Additionally, developers should be aware that while params and rng_key are included in the function signature, they are not utilized within the function body, which might indicate a need for future implementation or refactoring.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
Assuming action.shape[0] is 3 (batch size of 3), rewards is a predefined matrix with shape [B, num_actions], and dummy_embedding is defined as an array of zeros with shape [B, embedding_dim]:

RecurrentFnOutput(
    reward=array([1.0, 2.5, 0.8]),  # Example rewards for each action in the batch
    discount=array([0., 0., 0.]),     # Discount is zero for all actions
    prior_logits=array([[0., 0., 0.], [0., 0., 0.], [0., 0., 0.]]),  # Prior logits are zeros for all actions in the batch
    value=array([0., 0., 0.])         # Value is zero for all actions
),
dummy_embedding=array([[0., 0., 0.], [0., 0., 0.], [0., 0., 0.]])  # Dummy embedding for each action in the batch
***
## FunctionDef _make_bandit_decision_and_chance_fns(rewards, num_chance_outcomes)
**_make_bandit_decision_and_chance_fns**: The function of _make_bandit_decision_and_chance_fns is to create decision and chance recurrent functions tailored for bandit problems.

parameters: 
· rewards: A JAX array representing the rewards associated with each action.
· num_chance_outcomes: An integer indicating the number of possible chance outcomes.

Code Description: 
The function _make_bandit_decision_and_chance_fns generates two inner functions, decision_recurrent_fn and chance_recurrent_fn. These functions are designed to be used in a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) context, specifically for bandit problems where decisions lead directly to rewards without intermediate states. 

- The decision_recurrent_fn takes parameters, rng_key, action, and embedding as inputs but ignores the first two. It computes the reward based on the selected actions from the rewards array and constructs a dummy chance_logits matrix with only one valid outcome (set to 1.0) while others are set to negative infinity (-jnp.inf). The function returns an instance of mctx.DecisionRecurrentFnOutput containing these chance logits and a zero-initialized afterstate value, along with an updated embedding that includes the action taken.

- The chance_recurrent_fn also ignores its first three parameters (params, rng_key, chance_outcome) and operates on the afterstate_embedding. It extracts the action from this embedding to compute the reward again using the rewards array. This function returns an instance of mctx.ChanceRecurrentFnOutput with zero-initialized action logits, value, and discount factors, along with the computed reward and the original embedding.

The relationship between _make_bandit_decision_and_chance_fns and its caller in the project is evident in the test_stochastic_muzero_policy method. Here, the function generates decision and chance recurrent functions that are used to simulate a stochastic MCTS policy (stochastic_muzero_policy). The outputs from this stochastic policy are then compared against those from a deterministic MCTS policy (muzero_policy) to ensure equivalence when using a dummy chance function.

Note: 
The generated decision and chance recurrent functions assume no randomness in the chance outcomes, as indicated by the dummy_chance_logits matrix with only one valid outcome. This setup is suitable for bandit problems where each action directly leads to a reward without any intermediate stochastic events.

Output Example: 
Given rewards = jnp.array([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]]) and num_chance_outcomes = 5, the function returns two functions:
- decision_recurrent_fn: For an action of [0, 1] and embedding of zeros, it outputs (DecisionRecurrentFnOutput(chance_logits=[[1.0, -inf, -inf, -inf, -inf], [-inf, 1.0, -inf, -inf, -inf]], afterstate_value=[1.0, 4.0]), ([0, 1], zeros))
- chance_recurrent_fn: For an afterstate_embedding of ([0, 1], zeros), it outputs (ChanceRecurrentFnOutput(action_logits=[[0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0]], value=[1.0, 4.0], discount=[0.0, 0.0], reward=[1.0, 4.0]), zeros)
### FunctionDef decision_recurrent_fn(params, rng_key, action, embedding)
**decision_recurrent_fn**: The function of decision_recurrent_fn is to process an action and state embedding to produce dummy chance logits and zero afterstate values.

parameters: 
· params: Parameters required by the function (not used in this implementation).
· rng_key: A random number generator key (not used in this implementation).
· action: An array representing actions taken, with shape [B], where B is the batch size.
· embedding: An array representing state embeddings, with shape [B, E], where E is the embedding dimension.

Code Description: The decision_recurrent_fn function takes four parameters but only utilizes the action and embedding. It calculates the reward for each action in the batch using an external rewards array indexed by batch indices and actions. However, this calculated reward is not used further in the function. Instead, it creates dummy chance logits with a shape of [B, C], where C is the number of chance outcomes, setting all values to negative infinity except for the first column which is set to 1.0. This setup implies that only the first chance outcome has a non-zero probability. The afterstate embedding is constructed as a tuple containing the action and the original state embedding. Finally, the function returns an instance of DecisionRecurrentFnOutput with the dummy chance logits and zero afterstate values, along with the afterstate embedding.

The relationship with its callees in the project from a functional perspective involves encapsulating the output within the DecisionRecurrentFnOutput class, which is designed to store structured results of decision-making processes. This function is part of a testing scenario where it simulates decision-making by generating dummy values for chance outcomes and setting afterstate values to zero.

Note: Points to note about the use of the code
When using decision_recurrent_fn, ensure that the dimensions of action and embedding align with the expected batch size B and embedding dimension E. The function currently does not utilize params or rng_key, so these parameters can be set to any value without affecting the output. Additionally, while this function generates dummy values for demonstration purposes in a testing scenario, practical applications should populate chance_logits and afterstate_value with meaningful data derived from the decision-making process.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
For a batch size B=2 and number of chance outcomes C=3, the output might look like this:
DecisionRecurrentFnOutput(
    chance_logits=[[1.0, -inf, -inf],
                   [1.0, -inf, -inf]],
    afterstate_value=[0.0, 0.0]
), (action=[a1, a2], embedding=[[e11, e12, ..., e1E], [e21, e22, ..., e2E]])
***
### FunctionDef chance_recurrent_fn(params, rng_key, chance_outcome, afterstate_embedding)
**chance_recurrent_fn**: The function of chance_recurrent_fn is to process chance nodes by computing rewards based on afterstate actions and embeddings while setting action logits, values, and discounts to zero.

parameters: The parameters of this Function.
· params: Parameters required for the function (not used in the current implementation).
· rng_key: A random number generator key (not used in the current implementation).
· chance_outcome: The outcome of a chance event (not used in the current implementation).
· afterstate_embedding: A tuple containing afterstate actions and embeddings.

Code Description: The chance_recurrent_fn function is designed to handle chance nodes in an environment where transitions are stochastic. It takes several parameters, but only utilizes `afterstate_embedding`, which consists of afterstate actions and embeddings. The function calculates the reward for each state based on the afterstate actions using a predefined rewards array indexed by batch size and action. It then returns an instance of `ChanceRecurrentFnOutput` with computed rewards and zeroed-out action logits, values, and discounts.

The relationship with its callees in the project from a functional perspective is that chance_recurrent_fn generates an output structured as `ChanceRecurrentFnOutput`. This class encapsulates the results of processing chance nodes, specifically focusing on rewards while setting other attributes to zero. This setup is typical in scenarios where chance nodes do not influence action selection directly but affect state transitions and associated rewards.

Note: Points to note about the use of the code
Developers should ensure that the dimensions of the attributes match the expected batch size `B` and number of actions `A`. The function assumes that all outputs are provided as JAX arrays (`chex.Array`) for efficient computation, especially in environments where parallel processing is beneficial. When implementing similar functions or using this class in other parts of the project, it is crucial to maintain consistency in how these attributes are computed and utilized to ensure accurate modeling of stochastic transitions and rewards.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
```
ChanceRecurrentFnOutput(
    action_logits=DeviceArray([[0., 0.], [0., 0.]], dtype=float32),
    value=DeviceArray([0., 0.], dtype=float32),
    discount=DeviceArray([0., 0.], dtype=float32),
    reward=DeviceArray([1., 2.], dtype=float32)
), embedding
```
In this example, the `action_logits`, `value`, and `discount` are zeroed-out arrays of shape `[B, A]`, `[B]`, and `[B]` respectively, while the `reward` array contains computed rewards for each state in the batch. The `embedding` is returned unchanged from the input.
***
## FunctionDef _get_deepest_leaf(tree, node_index)
**_get_deepest_leaf**: The function of _get_deepest_leaf is to find the deepest leaf node in a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) tree starting from a given node index and return that leaf along with its depth.

parameters: 
· tree: An unbatched MCTS tree state.
· node_index: The index of the node from which the subtree inspection begins.

Code Description: The function _get_deepest_leaf is designed to traverse an MCTS tree starting from a specified node (node_index) and identify the deepest leaf node within the subtree rooted at that node. It recursively explores each child node, checking if it has been visited before proceeding further down the tree. If multiple leaves are found at the same maximum depth, the function selects the one with the highest visit count. The function uses a simple loop to iterate over all possible actions (children) of the current node and calls itself recursively for each valid child node (i.e., nodes that have been visited). It keeps track of the deepest leaf found so far and updates this information whenever it finds a deeper or equally deep leaf with a higher visit count. The function returns a tuple containing the index of the deepest leaf and its depth.

Note: This function assumes that the tree structure is properly initialized and that the node_index provided points to a valid node within the tree. It also relies on the presence of certain attributes in the tree object, such as children_index, UNVISITED, and node_visits, which are used to navigate and evaluate the nodes.

Output Example: If the function is called with a tree where the deepest leaf at the maximum depth has an index of 15 and a depth of 4, the output would be (15, 4). This indicates that the deepest leaf in the subtree starting from the given node_index is located at index 15 and is 4 levels deep within the tree.
## ClassDef PoliciesTest
**PoliciesTest**: The function of PoliciesTest is to test various functionalities related to policy application and action selection in the context of reinforcement learning algorithms.

attributes: The attributes of this Class.
· No explicit class-level or instance-level attributes are defined in the provided code snippet.

Code Description: The description of this Class.
The PoliciesTest class inherits from absltest.TestCase, indicating that it is a test case designed to verify the correctness of specific functions and behaviors within a reinforcement learning framework. It includes several methods that test different aspects of policy application, temperature scaling, action masking, and various policy implementations such as MuZero and Stochastic MuZero.

The test_apply_temperature_* methods check how logits are transformed under different temperatures:
- `test_apply_temperature_one` verifies the behavior when the temperature is set to 1.0, which should not alter the relative differences between logits.
- `test_apply_temperature_two` tests a higher temperature (2.0), expecting logits to be scaled down by this factor after subtracting the maximum logit value.
- `test_apply_temperature_zero` and `test_apply_temperature_zero_on_large_logits` examine edge cases where the temperature is set to 0, which should result in a softmax distribution that heavily favors the highest logit or handles large values appropriately.

The test_mask_invalid_actions methods ensure that invalid actions are correctly masked out during policy application:
- `test_mask_invalid_actions` tests a scenario with some valid and some invalid actions, expecting the softmax probabilities of invalid actions to be zero.
- `test_mask_all_invalid_actions` checks behavior when all actions are marked as invalid, leading to an equal probability distribution across all actions.

The test_muzero_policy method verifies the functionality of the MuZero policy implementation:
- It sets up a root node with specific prior logits and value, applies a recurrent function to simulate interactions, and asserts that the output action and action weights match expected values given the setup.

The test_gumbel_muzero_policy methods validate the Gumbel MuZero policy implementation under different conditions:
- `test_gumbel_muzero_policy` tests the policy with invalid actions specified, checking the resulting action, action weights, visit counts, and maximum depth of the search tree.
- `test_gumbel_muzero_policy_without_invalid_actions` performs a similar test but without any invalid actions, ensuring that the policy behaves as expected in this scenario.

The test_stochastic_muzero_policy method confirms that the Stochastic MuZero policy is equivalent to the standard MuZero policy when using a dummy chance function:
- It sets up a root node with multiple states and applies both policies, comparing their outputs to ensure consistency.

Note: Points to note about the use of the code
This class should be used as part of a testing suite for reinforcement learning algorithms that utilize the specified policy implementations. Developers can run these tests to verify that changes in the underlying functions do not introduce unintended behavior. The test cases rely on specific numerical values and configurations, so any modifications to the tested functions may require corresponding updates to the expected results in the assertions.
### FunctionDef test_apply_temperature_one(self)
**test_apply_temperature_one**: The function of test_apply_temperature_one is to verify that the _apply_temperature function behaves correctly when the temperature parameter is set to 1.

parameters: 
· No explicit parameters are defined for this function as it uses predefined values within its body.

Code Description: The test_apply_temperature_one function is designed to test the behavior of the _apply_temperature function specifically when the temperature is set to 1.0. It begins by creating an array of logits using jnp.arange, which generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 5 with a data type of float32. These logits represent unnormalized probabilities used in decision-making processes such as those found in reinforcement learning algorithms.

The function then calls _apply_temperature, passing the generated logits and a temperature value of 1.0. The purpose of this call is to apply the temperature scaling mechanism defined within _apply_temperature. According to the documentation for _apply_temperature, when the temperature is set to 1, the logits should remain unchanged except for a subtraction of their maximum value to ensure numerical stability.

The result from _apply_temperature (new_logits) is then compared against the original logits minus their maximum value using np.testing.assert_allclose. This assertion checks that the values in new_logits are sufficiently close to those expected after applying the temperature scaling with a temperature of 1, which should not alter the relative differences between the logits.

This test case is crucial for ensuring that the _apply_temperature function correctly handles the edge case where no additional randomness is introduced into the decision-making process (i.e., when temperature equals 1).

Note: This function does not accept any parameters from external sources and relies on predefined values. It is specifically tailored to validate the behavior of the _apply_temperature function under a particular condition, ensuring that the implementation adheres to expected outcomes in scenarios where no scaling should occur due to the neutral temperature value of 1.0.
***
### FunctionDef test_apply_temperature_two(self)
**test_apply_temperature_two**: The function of test_apply_temperature_two is to verify that the _apply_temperature function correctly applies a temperature of 2.0 to a set of logits.

parameters: 
· No explicit parameters are defined for this function as it operates with predefined values within its scope.

Code Description: The test_apply_temperature_two function is designed to validate the behavior of the _apply_temperature function when the temperature parameter is set to 2.0. It begins by creating an array of logits using jnp.arange, which generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 5 with a data type of float32. The temperature variable is explicitly set to 2.0.

The function then calls _apply_temperature, passing the logits and temperature as arguments. This function adjusts the logits by subtracting the maximum logit value from each element in the logits array to ensure numerical stability before dividing by the temperature. The result is stored in new_logits.

To verify that _apply_temperature behaves as expected, the test uses np.testing.assert_allclose to compare new_logits with the manually computed expected values. The expected values are calculated by subtracting the maximum logit from each element in the logits array and then dividing by the temperature. This comparison ensures that the output of _apply_temperature matches the theoretical result within a small tolerance.

Note: This test is crucial for confirming that the temperature scaling mechanism works correctly, especially when higher temperatures are applied, which should make the distribution over actions smoother and more random. The use of np.testing.assert_allclose allows for a precise comparison between the actual and expected outputs, accounting for any minor floating-point arithmetic differences.
***
### FunctionDef test_apply_temperature_zero(self)
**test_apply_temperature_zero**: The function of test_apply_temperature_zero is to verify the behavior of the _apply_temperature function when the temperature parameter is set to zero.

parameters: This function does not take any parameters explicitly as it is a test case designed to check a specific scenario within the policies_test.py module.

Code Description: The test_apply_temperature_zero function initializes an array of logits with values ranging from 0 to 3 using jnp.arange and converts them to float32 data type. It then calls the _apply_temperature function, passing in these logits along with a temperature value of 0.0. The expected behavior when the temperature is zero is for all but the maximum logit to be transformed into very large negative values, effectively making the action selection deterministic by assigning an extremely high probability to the action with the highest logit value and negligible probabilities to others. The function uses np.testing.assert_allclose to compare the output of _apply_temperature against a predefined array of expected values, ensuring that the actual output matches these expectations within a relative tolerance (rtol) of 1e-3.

Note: This test case is crucial for validating the special handling of zero temperature in the _apply_temperature function. It ensures that when the temperature parameter is set to zero, the function correctly implements the deterministic behavior as described, which is essential for scenarios where precise and predictable action selection is required. The use of np.testing.assert_allclose with a specified relative tolerance allows for minor numerical differences between the expected and actual outputs while still confirming their overall correctness.
***
### FunctionDef test_apply_temperature_zero_on_large_logits(self)
**test_apply_temperature_zero_on_large_logits**: The function of test_apply_temperature_zero_on_large_logits is to verify that applying a temperature of zero on large logits results in the expected behavior where all but the maximum logit are set to negative infinity, making action selection deterministic.

parameters: This function does not take any parameters as it is a test case designed to run with predefined values.

Code Description: The test_apply_temperature_zero_on_large_logits function initializes an array of logits containing both very large and very small values, including positive and negative infinity. It then calls the _apply_temperature function from policies.py with these logits and a temperature value of zero. The expected outcome is that all logits except the maximum will be transformed to negative infinity, while the maximum logit will remain at zero, reflecting a deterministic selection scenario. This behavior is verified using np.testing.assert_allclose, which checks if the computed new_logits match the expected array values within a tolerance.

The _apply_temperature function, called within this test case, adjusts logits by dividing them by a specified temperature. When the temperature is set to zero, it handles this special case by returning negative infinity for all but the maximum logit value, ensuring that only the action with the highest logit probability is selected with near certainty.

Note: This test case is crucial for validating the correctness of the _apply_temperature function's behavior when the temperature parameter is zero. It ensures that the function can handle edge cases involving large logits without causing numerical instability or incorrect results. Developers should be aware that this test is part of a suite designed to confirm the reliability and robustness of the policy functions used in the project, particularly in scenarios requiring deterministic action selection.
***
### FunctionDef test_mask_invalid_actions(self)
**test_mask_invalid_actions**: The function of test_mask_invalid_actions is to verify that the _mask_invalid_actions function correctly masks invalid actions by assigning them a very low logit value.

parameters: 
· logits: A JAX NumPy array representing the raw unnormalized scores (logits) for each action.
· invalid_actions: A JAX NumPy array of the same shape as logits, where each element is 1 if the corresponding action is invalid and 0 if it is valid.

Code Description: The test_mask_invalid_actions function begins by defining a set of logits and an indicator array for invalid actions. It then calls the _mask_invalid_actions function with these inputs to obtain the masked logits. The expected behavior is that the logits corresponding to invalid actions are replaced with a very low value (min_logit), effectively making their probability negligible when applying the softmax function. The test checks this by comparing the softmax of the masked logits against an array where only valid actions have non-zero probabilities, and all invalid actions have zero probabilities.

The _mask_invalid_actions function is called within this test to ensure that it correctly processes the input logits and invalid action indicators. It does so by first normalizing the logits (subtracting the maximum logit value for numerical stability), then using a where clause to replace invalid action logits with a minimum possible logit value defined by the data type of the logits array.

Note: This test is crucial for ensuring that the policy in reinforcement learning or decision-making systems does not consider invalid actions during its operation. The use of very low values instead of negative infinity prevents numerical issues such as NaNs when applying the softmax function to the masked logits. Developers should ensure that the shapes of logits and invalid_actions arrays match before calling _mask_invalid_actions to avoid runtime errors.
***
### FunctionDef test_mask_all_invalid_actions(self)
**test_mask_all_invalid_actions**: The function of test_mask_all_invalid_actions is to verify that when all actions are invalid, the masking process results in equal probabilities for each action.

parameters: This Function does not take any parameters directly as it is a test method within a class and uses predefined values for its internal operations.
· parameter1: None (The function uses hardcoded values for logits and invalid_actions)

Code Description: The description of this Function.
This function tests the behavior of the _mask_invalid_actions function in scenarios where all actions are marked as invalid. It initializes an array of logits with negative infinity values, indicating that no action is preferred initially. Similarly, it creates an array of invalid actions where each action is marked as invalid (represented by 1.0). The function then calls _mask_invalid_actions to apply the masking process on these logits based on the invalid actions array.

The expected behavior is that since all actions are invalid, the masking process should assign equal probabilities to each action after applying a softmax operation. This is verified using np.testing.assert_allclose, which checks if the softmax of the masked logits matches an array where each action has a probability of 0.25 (indicating equal distribution).

The relationship with its callees in the project from a functional perspective is that test_mask_all_invalid_actions relies on _mask_invalid_actions to perform the actual masking operation. By ensuring that _mask_invalid_actions behaves correctly when all actions are invalid, this test function contributes to validating the robustness and correctness of the policy handling mechanism within the project.

Note: Points to note about the use of the code
This function is specifically designed as a unit test and should be run within a testing framework. It does not accept external parameters and is intended to verify a specific edge case in the _mask_invalid_actions function. Developers should ensure that this test is part of their continuous integration process to catch any regressions or issues related to action masking when all actions are invalid.

## Usage Example

Below is an example demonstrating how to use the `DatabaseConnection` class to connect to a database, execute a query, and manage transactions:

```java
try {
    DatabaseConnection db = new DatabaseConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase?user=root&password=secret");
    db.connect();

    // Start a transaction
    db.beginTransaction();
    
    // Execute an update statement
    int rowsAffected = db.executeUpdate("UPDATE users SET status='active' WHERE id=1");
    System.out.println(rowsAffected + " row(s) updated.");
    
    // Commit the transaction
    db.commitTransaction();
} catch (Exception e) {
    // Handle exceptions
    e.printStackTrace();
} finally {
    // Ensure the connection is closed
    db.disconnect();
}
```
