### FunctionDef num_actions(self)
**num_actions**: The function of num_actions is to return the number of possible actions from any node in the tree.

parameters: This Function does not take any parameters.

Code Description: The num_actions method retrieves the number of actions available at each node by accessing the shape attribute of the children_index array. Specifically, it returns the last dimension size of the children_index array, which corresponds to the number of actions that can be taken from a given node in the tree structure. This value is consistent across all nodes as the same set of actions is typically available from every node.

In the project, num_actions is utilized by several functions to determine the range of possible actions during operations such as converting the tree into a graph for visualization or selecting an action based on the MuZero algorithm's criteria. For example, in convert_tree_to_graph, it ensures that the provided action labels match the number of actions available in the tree, and in muzero_action_selection, it is used to iterate over all possible actions when calculating scores for action selection.

Note: The function assumes that the children_index array has been properly initialized with a consistent shape across all nodes, where the last dimension represents the actions. Misalignment or incorrect initialization of this array can lead to errors in functions relying on num_actions.

Output Example: If the tree is set up such that each node can have 4 possible actions, calling num_actions would return 4.
***
### FunctionDef num_simulations(self)
**num_simulations**: The function of num_simulations is to return the number of simulations performed in the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) tree.

parameters: The parameters of this Function.
Â· This function does not take any explicit parameters.

Code Description: The description of this Function.
The `num_simulations` method calculates and returns the total number of simulations conducted during the MCTS process. It achieves this by accessing the shape of the `node_visits` attribute, which is a tensor where each entry represents the number of times a node has been visited across different simulations. The method subtracts one from the last dimension's size to get the correct count of simulations since the initial state (root) is not counted as a simulation but rather the starting point.

In the context of the project, this function is utilized by other parts of the codebase that need to know how many simulations have been performed. For example, in `examples/visualization_demo.py/convert_tree_to_graph`, it is used to iterate over all nodes generated during the simulations to create a visual representation of the search tree. Similarly, in `mctx/_src/tests/tree_test.py/tree_to_pytree`, it helps in iterating through each node created by the simulations to convert the MCTS tree into a nested dictionary format for testing purposes.

Note: Points to note about the use of the code
This function should be called on an instance of the `Tree` class that has undergone at least one simulation. Calling this method before any simulations have been performed will result in an incorrect count, as it relies on the `node_visits` tensor being populated with visitation data.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
If 100 simulations have been conducted, calling `num_simulations()` would return `100`.

# DataProcessor Class Documentation

## Overview

The `DataProcessor` class is a core component of the data handling module in the application. It provides methods for loading, transforming, and exporting datasets. The class is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing developers to integrate custom processing logic as needed.

## Class Definition

```python
class DataProcessor:
    def __init__(self, source: str, target: str):
        """
        Initializes a new instance of the DataProcessor class.
        
        :param source: Path or identifier for the input data source.
        :param target: Path or identifier for the output data destination.
        """
```

## Methods

### load_data()

```python
def load_data(self) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Loads data from the specified source into a pandas DataFrame.

    :return: A pandas DataFrame containing the loaded data.
    """
```

- **Description**: This method reads data from the location specified by `source` during initialization and returns it as a pandas DataFrame. The format of the data (e.g., CSV, Excel) is inferred based on the file extension.
  
### transform_data()

```python
def transform_data(self, df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Applies predefined transformations to the input DataFrame.

    :param df: A pandas DataFrame containing the data to be transformed.
    :return: A pandas DataFrame with the transformed data.
    """
```

- **Description**: This method applies a series of transformations to the provided DataFrame `df`. The transformations include cleaning, normalization, and aggregation steps as defined in the class implementation.

### export_data()

```python
def export_data(self, df: pd.DataFrame) -> None:
    """
    Exports the transformed data to the specified target location.
    
    :param df: A pandas DataFrame containing the data to be exported.
    """
```

- **Description**: This method writes the provided DataFrame `df` to the location specified by `target` during initialization. The format of the output file is inferred based on the file extension.

## Example Usage

```python
# Initialize DataProcessor with source and target paths
processor = DataProcessor(source='data/input.csv', target='data/output.csv')

# Load data from source
data_frame = processor.load_data()

# Transform loaded data
transformed_df = processor.transform_data(data_frame)

# Export transformed data to target
processor.export_data(transformed_df)
```

## Notes

- Ensure that the `source` and `target` paths are correctly specified and accessible.
- The transformations applied by `transform_data()` can be customized by modifying the method implementation.

## FunctionDef infer_batch_size(tree)
**infer_batch_size**: The function of infer_batch_size is to recover the batch size from a `Tree` data structure.

**parameters**: 
Â· tree: An instance of the `Tree` class representing the state of a search tree, which includes various attributes such as node visits, values, and embeddings structured in arrays with a batch dimension.

**Code Description**: The function infer_batch_size is designed to determine the batch size from the provided `Tree` object. It first checks if the `node_values` attribute of the `Tree` instance has exactly two dimensions, indicating that it includes a batch dimension. If not, it raises a `ValueError`. Then, it uses `chex.assert_equal_shape_prefix` to ensure that all leaves in the tree structure have at least one common shape prefix, which is essential for maintaining consistency across different parts of the tree data. Finally, it returns the size of the first dimension of the `node_values` array, which corresponds to the batch size.

The function infer_batch_size plays a crucial role in ensuring that operations on the search tree are performed consistently across all elements in the batch. It is called by other functions within the project, such as `expand` and `update_tree_node`, to determine the batch size before performing batch-wise operations. This ensures that these functions can correctly handle multiple inputs simultaneously.

**Note**: The function assumes that the input `Tree` object has been properly initialized with a consistent shape across all its attributes. If the `node_values` attribute does not have exactly two dimensions, or if there is an inconsistency in the shapes of the leaves in the tree structure, the function will raise an error.

**Output Example**: 
If the `node_values` attribute of the input `Tree` object has a shape of `[32, 100]`, indicating that there are 32 elements in the batch and each element has 100 nodes, then the function infer_batch_size will return `32`.
## ClassDef SearchSummary
**SearchSummary**: The function of SearchSummary is to encapsulate statistics from Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) operations.

attributes: The attributes of this Class.
Â· visit_counts: An array representing the number of visits each action has received during the MCTS process.
Â· visit_probs: An array indicating the probabilities derived from the visit counts, normalized by the total number of visits for each state.
Â· value: An array containing the estimated values of the root nodes in the MCTS tree.
Â· qvalues: An array holding the Q-values (expected utility) for actions taken at the root node.

Code Description: The SearchSummary class is designed to store and provide structured access to key statistics obtained from a Monte Carlo Tree Search. These statistics are crucial for understanding the behavior of the search process, particularly in terms of action selection and state evaluation. The visit_counts attribute tracks how frequently each action has been explored, which helps in assessing the exploration-exploitation trade-off during MCTS. The visit_probs attribute normalizes these counts to probabilities, offering a more interpretable measure of action preference based on empirical data gathered by the search. The value attribute represents the estimated utility or reward associated with the root node(s) in the tree, serving as a direct output of the MCTS process for decision-making purposes. Lastly, the qvalues attribute provides the Q-values for actions originating from the root node, which are essential for evaluating the expected outcomes of different action choices.

The SearchSummary class is instantiated within the summary method of the Tree class. This method aggregates and computes various statistics related to the root node of the MCTS tree, including visit counts, induced probabilities, estimated values, and Q-values. By encapsulating these statistics into a SearchSummary object, the method provides a structured and accessible way for external components of the system to retrieve and utilize the results of the MCTS process.

Note: Points to note about the use of the code
Developers should ensure that the input arrays (visit_counts, visit_probs, value, qvalues) are correctly shaped and compatible with each other as expected by the SearchSummary class. The attributes within this class are intended for read-only access; modifying them directly may lead to inconsistent or unexpected behavior in the MCTS process. Additionally, understanding the context in which these statistics are generated (e.g., the specific actions and states represented) is crucial for interpreting their significance accurately.
## FunctionDef _unbatched_qvalues(tree, index)
**_unbatched_qvalues**: The function of _unbatched_qvalues is to compute the Q-value for a single node index in a given search tree.

**parameters**: 
Â· tree: An instance of the Tree class representing the state of a search tree.
Â· index: An integer indicating the specific node index for which the Q-value needs to be computed.

**Code Description**: The _unbatched_qvalues function calculates the Q-value for a specified node in the search tree. It first asserts that the rank of the children_discounts array is 2, ensuring it has the expected shape [B, N, num_actions]. Then, it computes the Q-value using the formula: `children_rewards[index] + children_discounts[index] * children_values[index]`. This formula combines the immediate reward for taking an action from the current node with the discounted future value of that action. The function returns this computed Q-value as an integer.

The _unbatched_qvalues function is a helper function used by the qvalues method in the Tree class. When the qvalues method receives multiple indices, it vectorizes the computation using jax.vmap and calls _unbatched_qvalues for each index. If only a single index is provided, it directly invokes _unbatched_qvalues.

**Note**: The function assumes that the tree parameter is properly initialized with all necessary arrays having the correct shapes as defined in the Tree class documentation. Additionally, the index should be within the valid range of node indices in the tree to avoid out-of-bounds errors.

**Output Example**: If the children_rewards at index 5 are 10, children_discounts at index 5 are 0.9, and children_values at index 5 are 20, then the computed Q-value would be `10 + 0.9 * 20 = 28`.
