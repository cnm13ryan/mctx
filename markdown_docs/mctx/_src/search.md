### FunctionDef body_fun(sim, loop_state)
**body_fun**: The function of body_fun is to perform one iteration of the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm by simulating a trajectory, expanding nodes based on simulation results, and updating the tree values.

**parameters**: 
· sim: An integer representing the current simulation index.
· loop_state: A tuple containing the random number generator state (rng_key) and the MCTS tree state (tree).

**Code Description**: The body_fun function is a critical component of the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm, designed to execute one iteration of the search process. It begins by splitting the rng_key into three separate keys for different purposes: simulating the trajectory, expanding nodes, and backward updating the tree.

The simulate function is then called with the simulate_keys, current tree state, action_selection_fn, and max_depth parameters. This function traverses the MCTS tree from the root node until it reaches either an unvisited action or a specified maximum depth. The result of this simulation is a tuple containing the parent_index and action selected at the end of the simulation.

Next, the body_fun determines the next_node_index based on the children_index array in the tree. If the next_node_index indicates that the node has not been visited (Tree.UNVISITED), it assigns the current simulation index to this node. This ensures that nodes first expanded during a particular simulation are uniquely identified by their simulation index.

The expand function is then invoked with parameters including params, expand_key, tree, recurrent_fn, parent_index, action, and next_node_index. The purpose of this function is to create and evaluate child nodes from the given nodes and unvisited actions. It updates the MCTS tree state based on the results of the evaluation.

Following the expansion, the backward function is called with the updated tree and next_node_index as parameters. This function propagates the value from the leaf node back up to the root, updating each parent node's value based on the values of its children. This ensures that the MCTS tree reflects the most recent information about the state space.

Finally, body_fun updates the loop_state with the new rng_key and updated tree, preparing it for the next iteration of the search process.

**Note**: Developers should ensure that the rng_key parameter is properly managed to maintain randomness in action selection. The tree parameter must be correctly structured as an MCTS tree state object, and the recurrent_fn should provide valid evaluations for child nodes.

**Output Example**: 
Assuming a simple MCTS tree structure with a root node (index 0) and one child node (index 1), if the simulation index is 2, the function will simulate a trajectory from the root to an unvisited node, expand this node, and update the tree values from the newly expanded leaf node back up to the root. The updated loop_state will contain the new rng_key and the modified MCTS tree state reflecting these changes in the children_index, node_values, and other relevant attributes.
***
## ClassDef _SimulationState
**_SimulationState**: The function of _SimulationState is to encapsulate the state information required during the simulation loop in a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm.

attributes: The attributes of this Class.
· rng_key: A random number generator key used for generating random actions during the simulation.
· node_index: An integer representing the current index of the node being considered in the tree.
· action: An integer indicating the action selected at the current node.
· next_node_index: An integer denoting the index of the next node to be visited based on the selected action.
· depth: An integer that tracks the current depth of traversal within the tree.
· is_continuing: A boolean value that determines whether the simulation should continue or terminate.

Code Description: The _SimulationState class is a NamedTuple designed to store and manage the state information necessary for each iteration of the MCTS simulation loop. This includes the random number generator key (rng_key) used for stochastic decision-making, indices of the current node (node_index) and the next node to be visited (next_node_index), the selected action (action), the current depth in the tree (depth), and a boolean flag (is_continuing) that indicates whether the simulation should proceed or stop.

In the context of the project, _SimulationState is utilized within the simulate function, which performs the core simulation process by traversing the MCTS tree. The simulate function initializes an instance of _SimulationState with appropriate starting values and uses it to guide the simulation loop. During each iteration, the body_fun function updates the state based on the selected action and the current node's children, creating a new _SimulationState object that reflects the updated traversal information. This process continues until the is_continuing flag becomes False, indicating that either an unvisited node has been reached or the maximum depth (max_depth) has been exceeded.

Note: Points to note about the use of the code
Developers should ensure that all attributes of _SimulationState are correctly initialized and updated during the simulation loop. The rng_key must be properly managed to maintain randomness in action selection, while node_index, next_node_index, action, depth, and is_continuing should accurately reflect the current state of the traversal process. Incorrect management of these attributes can lead to improper behavior or termination of the simulation.
## FunctionDef simulate(rng_key, tree, action_selection_fn, max_depth)
**simulate**: The function of simulate is to traverse an MCTS tree from the root node until it reaches either an unvisited action or a specified maximum depth.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· rng_key: A random number generator state, which is consumed during the simulation.
· tree: An _unbatched_ MCTS tree state that represents the current state of the search tree.
· action_selection_fn: A function used to select an action at each node during the simulation process.
· max_depth: An integer representing the maximum depth allowed for the simulation traversal.

**Code Description**: The simulate function performs a core part of the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm by traversing the MCTS tree. It starts from the root node and selects actions based on the provided action_selection_fn until it either reaches an unvisited node or hits the maximum depth specified by max_depth. The simulation process is guided by the _SimulationState class, which encapsulates essential state information such as the current random number generator key (rng_key), indices of nodes being considered (node_index and next_node_index), the selected action (action), the current depth in the tree (depth), and a boolean flag (is_continuing) that determines whether the simulation should continue. The function uses JAX's while_loop to repeatedly apply the body_fun, which updates the _SimulationState based on the selected actions and the structure of the MCTS tree until the termination condition is met.

The simulate function is called within the body_fun of the search process, where it plays a crucial role in determining the next node to be expanded or evaluated. In this context, simulate is used to guide the selection of actions for each simulation path, ensuring that the MCTS algorithm explores both visited and unvisited parts of the tree up to the specified depth.

**Note**: Points to note about the use of the code
Developers should ensure that the rng_key parameter is properly managed to maintain randomness in action selection. The tree parameter must be correctly structured as an _unbatched_ MCTS tree state, and the action_selection_fn should be a valid function capable of selecting actions based on the current node's state. Incorrect management of these parameters can lead to improper behavior or termination of the simulation.

**Output Example**: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
The simulate function returns a tuple `(parent_index, action)`, where `parent_index` is the index of the node reached at the end of the simulation, and `action` is the action selected from that node. For example, if the simulation ends at node 5 with an action of 2, the return value would be `(5, 2)`.
### FunctionDef cond_fun(state)
**cond_fun**: The function of cond_fun is to determine if the given state indicates that the process should continue.

parameters: 
· state: This parameter represents the current state of an ongoing process or simulation. It is expected to be an object with an attribute `is_continuing`.

Code Description: The function `cond_fun` takes a single argument, `state`, and returns the value of the `is_continuing` attribute from this `state` object. The purpose of this function is to provide a simple way to check whether the current state suggests that the process or simulation should proceed further.

Note: It is crucial that the `state` object passed to `cond_fun` has an `is_continuing` attribute, as the function directly accesses this attribute without any checks. If the `state` object does not have this attribute, the function will raise an AttributeError.

Output Example: Assuming there is a state object with `is_continuing` set to True, calling `cond_fun(state)` would return True, indicating that the process should continue. Conversely, if `is_continuing` were False, the function call would return False, signaling that the process should terminate or pause.
***
### FunctionDef body_fun(state)
**body_fun**: The function of body_fun is to prepare and return the next state of the simulation in a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm.

parameters: 
· state: An instance of _SimulationState representing the current state of the simulation, including attributes such as rng_key, node_index, depth, etc.

Code Description: The body_fun function takes the current state of the simulation and computes the next state based on the selected action. It starts by splitting the random number generator key (rng_key) to ensure randomness in subsequent operations. Using the split key, it selects an action for the current node from the tree structure, considering the node's index and the current depth. The function then determines the index of the next node to be visited based on the selected action. It also updates the depth by incrementing it by one.

The function checks whether the simulation should continue by verifying if the new depth is below a predefined maximum depth (max_depth) and if the next node has been previously visited. These conditions are combined using logical AND to determine the value of is_continuing, which indicates whether the simulation process should proceed or terminate.

Finally, body_fun returns a new instance of _SimulationState with updated attributes: rng_key, node_index, action, next_node_index, depth, and is_continuing. This new state encapsulates all necessary information for the subsequent iteration of the MCTS simulation loop.

Note: Developers must ensure that the input state parameter contains valid values for all its attributes to maintain the integrity of the simulation process. The rng_key should be properly managed to preserve randomness in action selection, while node_index, next_node_index, action, depth, and is_continuing should accurately reflect the current state of the traversal.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
_SimulationState(rng_key=DeviceArray([...], dtype=uint32), node_index=5, action=1, next_node_index=10, depth=3, is_continuing=True)

## FunctionDef expand(params, rng_key, tree, recurrent_fn, parent_index, action, next_node_index)
Doc is waiting to be generated...
## FunctionDef backward(tree, leaf_index)
**backward**: The function of backward is to update the MCTS tree state by propagating the value from a leaf node back up to the root.

**parameters**: 
· tree: the MCTS tree state to update, without the batch size.
· leaf_index: the node index from which to do the backward.

**Code Description**: The `backward` function is designed to traverse the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) tree structure starting from a specified leaf node and updating each parent node's value based on the values of its children. This process continues until the root node is reached. The function uses a while loop to iteratively update the tree nodes. Inside the loop, it calculates the new value for the current node's parent by considering the reward received at the child node, the discount factor applied to future rewards, and the number of visits to the parent node. It then updates the parent node's value and visit count in the tree structure. This process is repeated until the root node (identified by `Tree.ROOT_INDEX`) is reached.

The function starts by converting the `leaf_index` to a JAX NumPy array with an integer data type. It initializes the loop state with the current tree, the value of the leaf node, and the leaf index. The `cond_fun` checks if the current node index is not equal to the root index, ensuring that the loop continues until the root is reached. The `body_fun` performs the core update logic for each iteration: it calculates the new value for the parent node based on the reward and discounted future values from its children, updates the tree with these new values, and prepares the state for the next iteration by setting the current parent as the new index.

In the context of the project, this function is called within the `body_fun` of the search process. After simulating a trajectory in the MCTS tree and expanding nodes based on simulation results, the `backward` function is invoked to update the tree values from the newly expanded leaf node back up to the root. This ensures that the tree reflects the most recent information about the state space, improving the quality of future decisions made by the MCTS algorithm.

**Note**: The function assumes that the input tree structure (`tree`) and `leaf_index` are correctly formatted and valid within the context of the MCTS framework. It also relies on the presence of certain attributes in the `Tree` object, such as `parents`, `node_visits`, `action_from_parent`, `children_rewards`, `children_discounts`, `node_values`, and `children_visits`.

**Output Example**: 
Assuming a simple tree structure with a root node (index 0) and one child node (index 1), if the leaf_index is 1, the function will update the value of the root node based on the reward and discounted future values from the child node. The updated tree state will reflect these changes in the `node_values` and `node_visits` attributes for both nodes.
### FunctionDef cond_fun(loop_state)
**cond_fun**: The function of cond_fun is to determine whether the current index in a loop state is not equal to the root index of a Tree.

parameters: 
· loop_state: A tuple containing three elements, where the third element represents the current index being processed in a loop.

Code Description: The function cond_fun takes a single argument, `loop_state`, which is expected to be a tuple. It unpacks this tuple, ignoring the first two elements, and extracts the third element into the variable `index`. The function then returns a boolean value indicating whether `index` is not equal to `Tree.ROOT_INDEX`. This is typically used in looping constructs where iterations should continue until the root index of a tree structure is reached.

Note: Ensure that `loop_state` is always a tuple with at least three elements, and that `Tree.ROOT_INDEX` is defined within the context where this function is used. Misalignment in the expected structure of `loop_state` or an undefined `Tree.ROOT_INDEX` will lead to errors.

Output Example: If `loop_state` is `(None, None, 5)` and `Tree.ROOT_INDEX` is `0`, then `cond_fun(loop_state)` would return `True`. Conversely, if `index` were `0`, it would return `False`.
***
### FunctionDef body_fun(loop_state)
**body_fun**: The function of body_fun is to update the parent node's value based on the leaf node's value and other relevant information from a tree structure during the backward pass of a search algorithm.

parameters: 
· loop_state: A tuple containing three elements - the tree data structure, the current leaf value, and the index of the current leaf node.

Code Description: The function body_fun is designed to perform updates on a tree data structure as part of a backward pass in a search algorithm. It starts by extracting the tree, leaf_value, and index from the loop_state tuple. Using these values, it identifies the parent node of the current leaf node and retrieves necessary information such as the number of visits to the parent node (count), the action taken to reach the leaf node from the parent (action), the reward received for that action (reward), and the discount factor applied to future rewards (children_discounts).

The function then calculates a new value for the leaf node by incorporating the reward and discounted future values. This updated leaf_value is used to compute a new average value for the parent node, taking into account the number of times the parent has been visited previously. Additionally, it updates the children's values and visit counts based on the current action.

The tree data structure is then updated using the update function, which modifies specific elements within the tree's attributes (node_values, node_visits, children_values, children_visits) at the specified indices with the new computed values. This ensures that the tree accurately reflects the latest information after processing the leaf node during the backward pass.

Note: The function assumes that the tree data structure and its associated methods (such as replace and attribute accessors like parents, action_from_parent, children_rewards, children_discounts) are properly defined and implemented elsewhere in the project. It is crucial to ensure that the indices used for updates are valid and within the bounds of the respective arrays to avoid errors.

Output Example: If the loop_state contains a tree with specific node values and visits, a leaf_value of 10, and an index pointing to a leaf node, body_fun will compute new values for the parent node based on the reward and discount factors. It will then update the tree's node_values, node_visits, children_values, and children_visits arrays accordingly and return the updated tree along with the new leaf_value and the index of the parent node. For instance, if the original tree had a parent node value of 5 and it has been visited once before, and the computed new leaf_value is 12 after incorporating a reward of 3 and a discount factor of 0.9, the updated parent node value would be (5 * 1 + 12) / (1 + 1) = 8.5. The function would return this updated tree structure along with the new leaf_value of 12 and the index of the parent node.
***
## FunctionDef update(x, vals)
**update**: The function of update is to modify specific elements within an array-like structure using given indices.

parameters: 
· x: The original data structure (such as a JAX array) that needs updating.
· vals: The new values to be set at the specified indices in x.
· *indices: Variable-length argument list representing the indices where the updates should occur.

Code Description: The update function leverages the .at[indices].set(vals) method provided by libraries like JAX, which allows for efficient and concise updating of elements within an array-like structure. This method returns a new version of x with the specified elements replaced by vals at the given indices. In the context of the project, this function is used multiple times in the body_fun method to update various attributes (node_values, node_visits, children_values, children_visits) of a tree data structure based on computed values and indices. This ensures that the tree's state is accurately updated during the backward pass of a search algorithm.

Note: The use of *indices allows for flexibility in specifying multiple dimensions or nested structures when updating elements within x. It is crucial to ensure that the shape of vals matches the shape expected by the specified indices to avoid errors.

Output Example: If x is a JAX array [1, 2, 3, 4], and we call update(x, [99], 2), the function will return a new array [1, 2, 99, 4]. Similarly, if x is a 2D JAX array [[1, 2], [3, 4]], calling update(x, [88, 99], 0) would result in [[88, 99], [3, 4]].
## FunctionDef update_tree_node(tree, node_index, prior_logits, value, embedding)
**update_tree_node**: The function of update_tree_node is to update specific nodes within a search tree with new data.

parameters: 
· tree: `Tree` to whose node is to be updated.
· node_index: the index of the expanded node. Shape `[B]`.
· prior_logits: the prior logits to fill in for the new node, of shape `[B, num_actions]`.
· value: the value to fill in for the new node. Shape `[B]`.
· embedding: the state embeddings for the node. Shape `[B, ...]`.

Code Description: The update_tree_node function is designed to modify specific nodes within a given search tree structure. It accepts several parameters including the tree itself, the index of the node to be updated, prior logits, value, and embeddings. The function first infers the batch size from the tree using the infer_batch_size function, which ensures that operations are performed consistently across all elements in the batch. It then constructs a dictionary of updates for various attributes of the tree nodes such as children_prior_logits, raw_values, node_values, node_visits, and embeddings. These updates are applied to the specified node index using the batch_update function. The function returns a new tree with the updated nodes.

The update_tree_node function is crucial in maintaining the integrity and accuracy of the search tree during operations like expansion and instantiation from root. It is called by other functions such as expand, which creates and evaluates child nodes from given nodes and unvisited actions, and instantiate_tree_from_root, which initializes the tree state at the search root.

Note: The function assumes that the input tree has been properly initialized with consistent shapes across all its attributes. Misalignment or incorrect initialization can lead to errors in functions relying on update_tree_node.

Output Example: If a tree is provided where each node can have 4 possible actions, and the function is called with node_index=2, prior_logits=[[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]], value=[5], and embedding=[[0.5, 0.6]], the function will return a new tree where the node at index 2 has been updated with the provided prior logits, value, and embedding. The node_visits for this node will also be incremented by one to reflect the update.
## FunctionDef instantiate_tree_from_root(root, num_simulations, root_invalid_actions, extra_data)
Doc is waiting to be generated...
### FunctionDef _zeros(x)
_zeros: The function of _zeros is to create an array filled with zeros based on the shape of the input array x, extended by the batch_node dimension.

parameters:
· x: An input array whose data type and part of its shape will be used to determine the output array's properties.

Code Description: 
The function _zeros takes a single parameter, x, which is expected to be an array. It uses the jnp.zeros function from the JAX library to generate a new array filled with zeros. The shape of this new array is determined by concatenating the predefined batch_node dimension with all dimensions of x except for the first one (x.shape[1:]). This means that if x has a shape like (a, b, c), and batch_node is d, the resulting array will have a shape of (d, b, c). The data type of the new array matches the data type of the input array x.

Note: 
It is crucial to ensure that the variable batch_node is defined in the scope where this function is called. Additionally, the input x should be a valid JAX array for the jnp.zeros function to work correctly.

Output Example: 
If x is an array with shape (3, 4, 5) and dtype float32, and batch_node is set to 2, then _zeros(x) will return an array of zeros with shape (2, 4, 5) and dtype float32.
