## FunctionDef qtransform_by_min_max(tree, node_index)
**qtransform_by_min_max**: The function of qtransform_by_min_max is to return Q-values normalized by the given `min_value` and `max_value`.

**parameters**: 
路 tree: _unbatched_ MCTS tree state.
路 node_index: scalar index of the parent node.
路 min_value: given minimum value. Usually, the `min_value` is the minimum possible untransformed Q-value.
路 max_value: given maximum value. Usually, the `max_value` is the maximum possible untransformed Q-value.

**Code Description**: The function `qtransform_by_min_max` takes an MCTS tree state and a node index as inputs along with specified minimum and maximum values. It retrieves the Q-values for the specified node from the tree and normalizes these values using the provided `min_value` and `max_value`. The normalization formula applied is `(qvalues - min_value) / (max_value - min_value)`. Unvisited actions are assigned a Q-value of zero. The function ensures that the `node_index` is a scalar by asserting its shape. It then calculates the value score for each action, where unvisited actions receive the `min_value`. This value score is subsequently normalized and returned as an array with the shape `[num_actions]`.

The function leverages the `qvalues` method of the `Tree` class to fetch Q-values for a given node index. The normalization process ensures that all Q-values are scaled between 0 and 1, making them suitable for comparison and further analysis in the context of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).

**Note**: Ensure that the provided `min_value` and `max_value` accurately reflect the range of possible untransformed Q-values to avoid incorrect normalization. The function assumes an _unbatched_ MCTS tree state, meaning it processes a single batch at a time.

**Output Example**: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
If the Q-values for a node are `[0.5, 1.2, -0.3]`, `min_value` is `-1.0`, and `max_value` is `2.0`, the normalized Q-values would be calculated as follows:
- For the first action: `(0.5 - (-1.0)) / (2.0 - (-1.0)) = 0.833`
- For the second action: `(1.2 - (-1.0)) / (2.0 - (-1.0)) = 1.067` (clipped to 1.0 as it exceeds the normalization range)
- For the third action: `(-0.3 - (-1.0)) / (2.0 - (-1.0)) = 0.233`

Thus, the output array would be `[0.833, 1.0, 0.233]`. Note that any value exceeding the normalized range is clipped to ensure it remains within [0, 1].

## FunctionDef _rescale_qvalues(qvalues, epsilon)
_rescale_qvalues: The function of _rescale_qvalues is to rescale the given completed Q-values to be within the [0, 1] interval.

parameters:
路 qvalues: An array of Q-values that need to be rescaled.
路 epsilon: A small numeric value used as a minimum denominator to avoid division by zero during rescaling.

Code Description: The _rescale_qvalues function first determines the minimum and maximum values of the input Q-values along the last axis while keeping the dimensions intact. It then applies a linear transformation to each element in the Q-values array, subtracting the minimum value and dividing by the difference between the maximum and minimum values. To prevent division by zero, the denominator is clipped at a small positive value epsilon using jnp.maximum.

This function is called within qtransform_completed_by_mix_value when the rescale_values parameter is set to True. After completing the Q-values with either mixed or raw values based on the use_mixed_value flag, and before scaling them by visit counts and value scale factors, the completed Q-values are passed through _rescale_qvalues for normalization.

Note: It's important to ensure that the input qvalues array is not empty and contains valid numeric data. The epsilon parameter should be a small positive number to maintain numerical stability during rescaling.

Output Example: If the input qvalues are [2, 4, 6] and epsilon is 1e-8, the output will be approximately [0., 0.5, 1.] after rescaling.
## FunctionDef _complete_qvalues(qvalues)
**_complete_qvalues**: The function of _complete_qvalues is to return completed Q-values by replacing unvisited actions' values with a specified value.

parameters: 
路 qvalues: An array representing the current Q-values.
路 visit_counts: A corresponding array indicating the number of visits for each action.
路 value: A scalar value used to replace the Q-values of unvisited actions.

Code Description: The _complete_qvalues function is designed to handle scenarios where not all possible actions have been visited during a process such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). It takes in two main arrays, `qvalues` and `visit_counts`, which must be of equal shape. The `value` parameter is a scalar that will replace the Q-values for any action that has zero visits according to the `visit_counts` array.

The function first asserts that the shapes of `qvalues` and `visit_counts` are equal using `chex.assert_equal_shape`. It also checks that `value` is a scalar with `chex.assert_shape(value, [])`.

Using JAX's `jnp.where` function, it creates a new array `completed_qvalues` where each element is taken from `qvalues` if the corresponding element in `visit_counts` is greater than zero. Otherwise, it uses the provided `value`. This ensures that all actions have an assigned Q-value.

After constructing `completed_qvalues`, the function asserts again that its shape matches that of `qvalues` to maintain consistency.

In the context of the project, this function is utilized by `qtransform_completed_by_mix_value` within the same file. Specifically, after computing either a mixed value or a raw value based on the parameters provided, `_complete_qvalues` is called to fill in any missing Q-values for unvisited actions before further processing such as scaling and transformation.

Note: It is crucial that the `qvalues` and `visit_counts` arrays are of equal shape, and `value` should be a scalar. Failure to meet these conditions will result in assertion errors.

Output Example: If `qvalues = [1.0, 2.0, -1.0]`, `visit_counts = [1, 0, 3]`, and `value = 0.5`, the function would return `[1.0, 0.5, -1.0]`. Here, the second action's Q-value is replaced by `0.5` because its visit count is zero.
## FunctionDef _compute_mixed_value(raw_value, qvalues, visit_counts, prior_probs)
**_compute_mixed_value**: The function of _compute_mixed_value is to interpolate between a raw value and weighted Q-values based on visit counts and prior probabilities.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
路 raw_value: An approximate value of the state. Shape `[]`.
路 qvalues: Q-values for all actions. Shape `[num_actions]`. The unvisited actions have undefined Q-value.
路 visit_counts: The visit counts for all actions. Shape `[num_actions]`.
路 prior_probs: The action probabilities, produced by the policy network for each action. Shape `[num_actions]`.

**Code Description**: The description of this Function.
The function _compute_mixed_value calculates an estimator of the state value by interpolating between a raw value and weighted Q-values. It first computes the sum of visit counts across all actions to determine the total number of simulations. To avoid division by zero, it ensures that prior probabilities are at least as large as the smallest positive floating-point number representable in the data type of `prior_probs`. The function then calculates the sum of probabilities for visited actions and uses this to compute a weighted average of Q-values for these actions. This weighted average is then combined with the raw value, scaled by the total number of simulations, and normalized by adding one to the total number of simulations.

In the context of the project, _compute_mixed_value is called within `qtransform_completed_by_mix_value` in the file `mctx/_src/qtransforms.py`. This function uses _compute_mixed_value to compute a mixed value for unvisited actions when completing Q-values. The mixed value serves as an estimate for the state value based on both the raw value and the weighted Q-values of visited actions, incorporating prior probabilities to account for action preferences.

Additionally, the function is tested in `mctx/_src/tests/qtransforms_test.py` with two test cases: `test_mix_value` and `test_mix_value_with_zero_visits`. These tests ensure that _compute_mixed_value correctly computes the mixed value under normal conditions and handles cases where all visit counts are zero without causing division by zero errors.

**Note**: Points to note about the use of the code
Ensure that the input parameters have the correct shapes as specified. The `qvalues` for unvisited actions should be handled appropriately, although they do not affect the computation directly since their corresponding visit counts will be zero. The function assumes that `prior_probs` are non-negative and sums to one, which is typically ensured by using a softmax transformation on prior logits.

**Output Example**: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
Given:
- raw_value = -0.8
- qvalues = [2.0, 3.0, -1.0, 10.0]
- visit_counts = [0, 4.0, 4.0, 0]
- prior_probs = [0.1, 0.2, 0.7, 0.0]

The function will compute the mixed value as follows:
1. Sum of visit counts: 8.0
2. Adjusted prior probabilities to avoid division by zero: [0.1, 0.2, 0.7, 1e-36]
3. Sum of probabilities for visited actions: 0.9
4. Weighted Q-values: (0.2 * 3.0 / 0.9) + (0.7 * -1.0 / 0.9) = 0.6667 - 0.7778 = -0.1111
5. Mixed value: (-0.8 + 8.0 * -0.1111) / (8.0 + 1.0) = -0.9889

The output of the function will be approximately `-0.9889`.
