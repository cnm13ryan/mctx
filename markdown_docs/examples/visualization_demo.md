### FunctionDef node_to_str(node_i, reward, discount)
**node_to_str**: The function of node_to_str is to convert a tree node's information into a formatted string representation.

parameters: 
· node_i: An integer representing the index of the node within the tree.
· reward: A float value indicating the reward associated with the node, defaulting to 0.
· discount: A float value representing the discount factor applied to future rewards, defaulting to 1.

Code Description: The function constructs a string that includes the node's index, its associated reward formatted to two decimal places, the discount factor also formatted to two decimal places, the node's value from the tree's node_values array at the specified batch_index and node_i, and the number of visits to the node from the tree's node_visits array at the same indices. The string is returned with each piece of information on a new line.

Note: This function assumes that the variables `tree`, `batch_index`, `node_values`, and `node_visits` are defined in the scope where this function is called, as they are referenced directly within the function body without being passed as parameters. Ensure these variables are properly initialized before calling node_to_str to avoid runtime errors.

Output Example: 
"42
Reward: 10.50
Discount: 0.95
Value: 37.89
Visits: 123"
***
### FunctionDef edge_to_str(node_i, a_i)
**edge_to_str**: The function of edge_to_str is to convert an edge in a tree structure into a string representation that includes action labels, Q-values, and probabilities.

parameters: 
· node_i: An integer representing the index of the current node.
· a_i: An integer representing the index of the action taken from the current node.

Code Description: The function edge_to_str takes two parameters, node_i and a_i, which represent the current node index and the action index respectively. It first creates an array filled with the node index using jnp.full, where batch_size is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the code. Then, it computes the softmax probabilities of the children's prior logits for the given node from the tree structure. The function constructs a string that includes the action label corresponding to a_i, the Q-value for the action at node_i (formatted to two decimal places), and the probability of taking action a_i (also formatted to two decimal places). The Q-values are obtained by calling the qvalues method on the tree object with the constructed node index array. This method computes the Q-values for the specified node indices in the tree.

Note: The function assumes that variables such as batch_size, batch_index, tree, action_labels, and jnp (JAX NumPy) are defined elsewhere in the codebase. It also relies on the qvalues method of the Tree class from mctx/_src/tree.py to retrieve Q-values for specific node indices.

Output Example: If node_i is 3, a_i is 1, batch_size is 4, batch_index is 0, tree.children_prior_logits[batch_index, node_i] = [0.2, -0.5], and action_labels[a_i] = "MoveRight", the output string could be:
"MoveRight
Q: 0.34
p: 0.71" 
This example assumes that the softmax of tree.children_prior_logits[batch_index, node_i] results in probabilities approximately [0.29, 0.71], and the Q-value for action a_i at node_i is approximately 0.34.

## FunctionDef _make_batched_env_model(batch_size)
**_make_batched_env_model**: The function of _make_batched_env_model is to return a batched `(root, recurrent_fn)` tuple used for simulating an environment model.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· batch_size: An integer specifying the number of environments to simulate in parallel.
· transition_matrix: A chex.Array representing the state transitions in the environment. It has shape `[num_states, num_actions]` where `transition_matrix[s, a]` indicates the next state after taking action `a` from state `s`.
· rewards: A chex.Array containing the rewards for each (state, action) pair with shape `[num_states, num_actions]`.
· discounts: A chex.Array representing the discount factors for each (state, action) pair with shape `[num_states, num_actions]`.
· values: A chex.Array of initial state values with shape `[num_states]`, used to encourage exploration.
· prior_logits: A chex.Array containing the prior policy logits for each state with shape `[num_states, num_actions]`.

**Code Description**: The description of this Function.
The function `_make_batched_env_model` initializes and returns a batched environment model suitable for use in simulations such as those performed by search algorithms. It first asserts that the shapes of `transition_matrix`, `rewards`, `discounts`, and `prior_logits` are equal, ensuring consistency across these parameters. The number of states (`num_states`) and actions (`num_actions`) is derived from the shape of `transition_matrix`. It then verifies that the shape of `values` matches `[num_states]`.

The function defines a starting state (`root_state`) at index 0. Using this state, it constructs a `RootFnOutput` object named `root`, which includes:
- `prior_logits`: A batched array filled with the prior logits for actions from the initial state.
- `value`: A batched array filled with the value of the initial state.
- `embedding`: An array initialized to zero, representing the starting state index.

The function also defines a nested function `recurrent_fn`, which takes parameters `params` and `rng_key` (though these are not used in this implementation), along with `action` and `embedding`. The `recurrent_fn` asserts that the shapes of `action` and `embedding` match `[batch_size]`. It then constructs a `RecurrentFnOutput` object containing:
- `reward`: The reward for taking the specified action from the current state.
- `discount`: The discount factor for the (state, action) pair.
- `prior_logits`: The prior logits for actions from the current state.
- `value`: The value of the current state.

The function calculates the next state (`next_embedding`) based on the transition matrix and returns both the `RecurrentFnOutput` object and the `next_embedding`.

**Note**: Points to note about the use of the code
Ensure that all input arrays have consistent shapes as expected by the function. The `batch_size` parameter determines how many parallel environments are simulated, which can impact memory usage and computation time.

**Output Example**: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
The function returns a tuple `(root, recurrent_fn)`, where:
- `root`: An instance of `RootFnOutput` with batched prior logits, values, and embeddings initialized to represent the starting state across all environments in the batch.
- `recurrent_fn`: A function that takes action and embedding inputs to compute rewards, discounts, prior logits, and values for the next state, facilitating the simulation of environment transitions.

This function is utilized by `_run_demo` to set up a batched environment model for running search algorithms like Gumbel MuZero.
### FunctionDef recurrent_fn(params, rng_key, action, embedding)
**recurrent_fn**: The function of recurrent_fn is to compute the output from a state-action transition in a batched environment using specified parameters.

parameters: 
· params: Parameters required by the recurrent function (not used in this implementation).
· rng_key: A random number generator key (not used in this implementation).
· action: An array representing actions taken in each batch, with shape [batch_size].
· embedding: An array representing embeddings of states in each batch, with shape [batch_size].

Code Description: The function recurrent_fn is designed to process state-action transitions within a batched environment. It takes as input the current actions and state embeddings for each element in the batch. Although parameters (params) and a random number generator key (rng_key) are included in the function signature, they are not utilized within this specific implementation.

The function first asserts that both action and embedding have the correct shape [batch_size], ensuring consistency across inputs. It then constructs an instance of RecurrentFnOutput using predefined arrays for rewards, discounts, prior logits, and values indexed by the current embedding and action. This structured output encapsulates essential information about the transition, including immediate rewards, discount factors, policy logits, and state values.

Following the creation of the RecurrentFnOutput object, the function calculates the next embedding based on a transition matrix that maps the current embeddings and actions to new states. The function returns both the constructed RecurrentFnOutput instance and the updated embeddings for the next step in the environment simulation.

In the context of the project, recurrent_fn is utilized within batched environments where multiple state-action transitions are processed simultaneously. It plays a crucial role in algorithms like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) or policy gradient methods by providing standardized outputs that can be used for decision-making and value estimation.

Note: Points to note about the use of the code
Developers should ensure that the arrays rewards, discounts, prior_logits, values, and transition_matrix are correctly defined and indexed to match the expected inputs. The shapes of action and embedding must align with batch_size to maintain consistency during processing. Additionally, while params and rng_key are part of the function signature, they are not used in this implementation and can be omitted when calling the function.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
Assuming batch_size is 3, rewards = [[1, 2], [3, 4]], discounts = [[0.9, 0.8], [0.7, 0.6]], prior_logits = [[-1, 1], [-2, 2]], values = [5, 6], and transition_matrix = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]:
recurrent_fn_output = RecurrentFnOutput(
    reward=[3, 4],
    discount=[0.7, 0.6],
    prior_logits=[-2, 2],
    value=[6, 5]
)
next_embedding = [1, 0]
***
## FunctionDef main(_)
**main**: The function of main is to execute a search algorithm on a toy environment, process the results, and save a visualization of the search tree.

parameters:
· _: This parameter is not used within the function but is included to match the expected signature of the entry point function (commonly required by command-line interfaces).

Code Description: The `main` function initializes a random number generator key using JAX's random module with a seed value specified in the FLAGS. It then JIT-compiles the `_run_demo` function for performance optimization and starts the search process by calling this compiled function with the initialized random key. After obtaining the policy output from the search, it extracts specific information such as the selected action and its corresponding Q-value from the root state of the search tree. These details are printed to provide insights into the search results. The function then converts the search tree into a graph using the `convert_tree_to_graph` function, which is designed to visualize the structure of the search tree. Finally, it saves this graph as an image file specified in the FLAGS.

The relationship with its callees from a functional perspective is that `_run_demo` performs the core search algorithm on a predefined toy environment, generating a policy output that includes information about the search tree. The `convert_tree_to_graph` function takes this search tree and transforms it into a visual graph representation, which can be saved for further analysis or presentation.

Note: Points to note about the use of the code include ensuring that the FLAGS are correctly configured with appropriate values for seed, output_file, num_simulations, max_depth, and max_num_considered_actions. The random seed ensures reproducibility of results, while the other parameters control the behavior and scope of the search algorithm. Additionally, the `convert_tree_to_graph` function relies on the Graphviz library to generate the graph image, so it must be installed and properly configured in the environment.
