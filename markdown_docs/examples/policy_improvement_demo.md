## ClassDef DemoOutput
**DemoOutput**: The function of DemoOutput is to encapsulate various policy evaluation metrics after running a search algorithm on random data.

attributes: The attributes of this Class.
· prior_policy_value: Represents the value of the policy before any improvements, calculated as the sum of the softmax of prior logits multiplied by Q-values.
· prior_policy_action_value: Indicates the Q-value of the action selected by the prior policy using Gumbel random numbers.
· selected_action_value: Denotes the Q-value of the action selected after running the search algorithm.
· action_weights_policy_value: Computes the value of the new policy based on the weighted sum of Q-values according to the action weights derived from the search.

Code Description: The description of this Class.
DemoOutput is a structured data class designed to store and organize key metrics related to policy evaluation before and after applying a search algorithm. This class is instantiated within the _run_demo function, which simulates a scenario involving random prior logits and Q-values to demonstrate the functionality of a MuZero-like policy improvement algorithm.

In the context of the project, the _run_demo function initializes necessary parameters and generates random data for demonstration purposes. It then constructs a root output object representing the initial state of the search process and defines a recurrent function that simulates the dynamics of the environment based on randomly generated Q-values. The core of the demo involves running the gumbel_muzero_policy function, which performs the policy improvement by selecting actions through simulations guided by Gumbel noise.

After executing the policy improvement algorithm, _run_demo calculates several key metrics:
- prior_policy_value: This is computed as the expected value under the initial (prior) policy.
- prior_policy_action_value: It reflects the Q-value of the action that would be selected by the prior policy if it were to act in the environment.
- selected_action_value: Represents the Q-value of the action chosen after the search algorithm has been applied, indicating how the policy improvement affects action selection.
- action_weights_policy_value: This metric evaluates the overall value of the new policy based on a weighted sum of Q-values, where weights are determined by the action probabilities derived from the search process.

These metrics are then encapsulated within an instance of DemoOutput, which is returned alongside the updated random number generator key. The structured format provided by DemoOutput facilitates easy access and comparison of different policy evaluation metrics, enabling developers to assess the effectiveness of the policy improvement algorithm in various scenarios.

Note: Points to note about the use of the code
When utilizing the DemoOutput class, it is important to ensure that the input data (prior logits and Q-values) accurately represents the scenario being modeled. The values stored within an instance of DemoOutput are specific to the run of the _run_demo function and should be interpreted in the context of the random data generated for demonstration purposes. Developers may adapt this class or extend its functionality to suit more complex policy evaluation tasks or different types of search algorithms.

## FunctionDef _make_bandit_recurrent_fn(qvalues)
**_make_bandit_recurrent_fn**: The function of _make_bandit_recurrent_fn is to create a recurrent function specifically designed for a deterministic bandit environment.

parameters: 
· qvalues: A 2D array containing Q-values representing the expected rewards for each action in different states.

Code Description: The function _make_bandit_recurrent_fn returns another function named recurrent_fn, which is tailored for use in a deterministic bandit setting. This inner function takes four parameters: params (which is unused), rng_key (also unused), action (the actions taken by the agent), and embedding (used to track the depth of the search tree). The reward is calculated only at the root level (when embedding equals 0) using the Q-values corresponding to the selected actions. For all other levels, the reward is set to 0.0. The discount factor is set to 1 for single-player environments and -1 for zero-sum self-play environments; however, in this implementation, it is uniformly set to 1. The function constructs a RecurrentFnOutput object containing the calculated reward, discount, prior logits (set to zeros), and value (also set to zeros). It then increments the embedding by 1 to reflect the next level of the search tree and returns both the constructed output and the updated embedding.

Note: The parameters params and rng_key are not utilized within the recurrent_fn. This function is designed to be used in conjunction with a MuZero-like algorithm, where it serves as the dynamics network component responsible for generating the next state based on the current action.

Output Example: A possible return value of the recurrent_fn could be:
recurrent_fn_output = RecurrentFnOutput(reward=jnp.array([0.5, 1.2]), discount=jnp.array([1.0, 1.0]), prior_logits=jnp.zeros((2, num_actions)), value=jnp.array([0.0, 0.0]))
next_embedding = jnp.array([1, 1])

In the context of the project, _make_bandit_recurrent_fn is called within the _run_demo function to define the recurrent function used in the MuZero search algorithm. This setup allows the algorithm to simulate actions and evaluate their outcomes based on predefined Q-values, facilitating policy improvement through iterative simulations.
### FunctionDef recurrent_fn(params, rng_key, action, embedding)
**recurrent_fn**: The function of recurrent_fn is to compute the output for a single step in a bandit problem using the given parameters.

parameters: 
· params: Model parameters (not used in this function).
· rng_key: Random number generator key (not used in this function).
· action: Actions taken by the agent.
· embedding: Current state representation or embedding.

Code Description: The recurrent_fn is designed to process a single step in a bandit problem where rewards are non-zero only at the root state. It calculates the reward based on whether the current embedding is zero, indicating the root state. If it is, the reward is determined by indexing into the qvalues array with the action taken; otherwise, the reward is set to 0.0. The discount factor is set to 1 for all states in this single-player environment. The function then creates an instance of RecurrentFnOutput, setting the reward and discount as calculated, while initializing prior_logits and value to zero arrays of appropriate shapes. Finally, it increments the embedding by 1 to represent the next state.

In the project, recurrent_fn is used within policy improvement demonstrations to simulate interactions in a bandit environment where rewards are only given at the initial state. This function plays a crucial role in generating the necessary outputs for further processing in algorithms like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) or similar reinforcement learning methods.

Note: Points to note about the use of the code
Developers should ensure that the qvalues array is properly defined and accessible within the scope where recurrent_fn is called. Additionally, while params and rng_key are included as parameters, they are not utilized in this function's current implementation. Therefore, any values passed for these parameters will be ignored.

Output Example: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
Assuming action = [0, 1] and embedding = [0, 1], with qvalues defined as [[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], the function would produce:
recurrent_fn_output: RecurrentFnOutput(reward=[1.0, 0.0], discount=[1.0, 1.0], prior_logits=[[0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0]], value=[0.0, 0.0])
next_embedding: [1, 2]
***
## FunctionDef main(_)
**main**: The function of main is to execute a policy improvement demonstration by running multiple simulations and printing the improvements in action value and weights value.

parameters: 
· _: This parameter is not used within the function but is included to match the expected signature, likely for compatibility with command-line argument parsing frameworks.

Code Description: The main function initializes a random number generator key using the seed provided via FLAGS. It then jits (compiles) the _run_demo function for performance optimization. The function proceeds to run multiple simulations as specified by FLAGS.num_runs. In each iteration, it generates a new rng_key and calls the jitted _run_demo function, which performs a search algorithm on random data. The output from _run_demo includes various policy values and action values. The main function calculates the improvements in action value and weights value compared to the prior policy and prints these improvements, ensuring that they are non-negative.

Note: Points to note about the use of the code include ensuring that the FLAGS object is properly configured with the necessary parameters such as seed, num_runs, batch_size, num_actions, num_simulations, and max_num_considered_actions. The function relies on the _run_demo function for its core operations, which generates random data and performs a search algorithm to improve policy values.
